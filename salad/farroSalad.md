# Farro Salad

I had an amazing cold farro salad at a potluck; this is my attempt to reproduce it, with some reference to an [Italian Farro Salad](https://www.wellplated.com/italian-farro-salad/) from Well Plated.  They insist on Bob's Red Mill farro, but since I've never found any other brand I can't comment on that.


## Ingredients

### Salad

* 1 c. uncooked farro
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 cucumber, diced
* 1/2 pint small tomatoes, halved (optional)
* 1/2 c. crumbled feta
* 16 kalamata olives
* 3 T. capers (optional)
* 1/4 c. chopped fresh parsley, or 1/8 c. fresh basil, and/or fresh dill to taste

### Dressing

* 1/4 c. good olive oil
* 2 T. balsamic vinegar
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* salt, pepper, and/or oregano, to taste
* 1/2 tsp. honey (optional)
* 1 tsp. prepared mustard (optional)


## Directions

1. Boil at least 3 cups of salted water.
2. Add farro; cook at least 30 minutes.  Drain.
3. Cool.
4. Mix dressing.
5. Toss all ingredients.
6. Serve at room temperature or cold.


## Variants

Fry the farro in oil with shallots before cooking in stock, risotto-style.

Tahini is an interesting dressing variant.

Sweet onion and sun-dried tomato appear frequently in farro recipes, as do nuts (usually pistachios or pecans, but I would keep it Italian with pine nuts).  Cannellini are another interesting option.

Sometimes the cheese is parmesan instead of feta.

Often a literal green salad is mixed with farro to make a farro salad.

You can allegedly freeze farro (though not the rest of the salad), if that helps.

Farro can be made in an Instant Pot; the internet is conflicted about proportions but 1 c. farro to 1 1/2 c. water or stock seems to work with Bob's, without much need for draining afterwards.  Cook on high pressure for 12 minutes, then natural release.
