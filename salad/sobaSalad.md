# Soba Salad

Soba Salad is based on [a PopSugar recipe](http://www.popsugar.com/food/Sesame-Ginger-Soba-Noodle-Salad-Ribboned-Asparagus-29213595) that had more and healthier ingredients.  I cut it down in size and to the available ingredients, and also added a lot of eyeballing, since the dressing seemed excessive.

I made it to go with salmon poke instead of the usual sushi rice accompaniment; it was handy because it could (like sushi rice) sit on the counter while the salmon poke sat in the fridge waiting for dinnertime.

Serves 2, at room temperature.

## Ingredients

* 2 rolls of soba noodles
* 2 T. vegetable oil
* 1 T. toasted sesame oil
* 2 T. brown sugar
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1 cube frozen minced ginger
* 1 cube frozen chopped cilantro
* garlic powder
* mirin
* soy sauce
* handful toasted sesame seeds
* 2 scallions, sliced into rings


## Directions

1. Cook soba according to package directions and rinse with cold water.
2. Meanwhile, mix all liquid, spicy, and frozen ingredients.
3. Toss it all together.
