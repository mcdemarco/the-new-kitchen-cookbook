# Salmon Poke

One of the first things I made in the new kitchen was the salmon poke recipe [from Sushi Day](http://sushiday.com/archives/2014/05/26/salmon-poke/).  I cut the salt in half for Peter's sake (because he doesn't like it, not because it's bad for him or any other healthy person).

## Ingredients

* 3/4 to 1 lb. sushi-grade salmon, cubed
* 3 T. shoyu soy sauce
* 2 stalks green onion, chopped into rings
* 1 T. sesame oil
* 1 T. sesame seed
* 1/2 tsp. sea salt or to taste

## Directions

Mix.  Optionally refrigerate.  

Serve over sushi rice or [soba salad](../salad/sobaSalad.md).
