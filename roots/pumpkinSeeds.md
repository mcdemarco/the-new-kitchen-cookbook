# Roasted Pumpkin Seeds

The internet told me how to roast pumpkin seeds, and now I'm telling you.  There are more complicated ways to do it; I went with simple.

## Ingredients

* the innards of 1 carving pumpkin
* kosher salt
* olive oil
* smoked paprika (optional)

## Directions

1. Remove any large chunks of seedless pumpkin innards, and put the seedy guts into a large bowl of water.
2. Pick off the seeds into a second bowl of water.
3. Clean any remaining pumpkin strings off the seeds.
4. Optionally, spread the seeds out on a towel to dry overnight, in which case you can optionally salt them first.  Otherwise, pat dry.
5. Optionally, line your baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. In a bowl, toss the clean, dry seeds with oil and salt (if it's not already on them).
7. Spread seeds evenly on a baking sheet.
8. Sprinkle artfully with paprika.
9. Roast 25 minutes at 350Â° (with convection), stirring occasionally.

## Variants

You can mix in the spices at the olive oil step if you prefer.

There are a lot of spicing options out there, from sweet to hot, but I prefer my seeds mainly salty so I haven't investigated them.

I've seen advice to attach spices with egg white, and to parboil the seeds before roasting them.  I've heard something vague about brining them.  I haven't tried any of that, either.
