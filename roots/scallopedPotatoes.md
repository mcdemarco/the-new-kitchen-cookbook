# Scalloped Potatoes

This recipe began as half of [Chef Savvy's recipe](https://chefsavvy.com/scalloped-potatoes/), mostly because it was spicy and also mentioned russets.  (I had a few russets to use up for dinner at home, and didn't want to face the usual casserole full of them.)  The process is a bit similar to making [mac'n'cheese](../pasta/macncheese.md), but the cooking time is shorter and the baking time longer.  It can be made in advance and reheated.

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 lbs russet potatoes, sliced 1/8" thin
* 2 T. butter
* 1/2 onion, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 T. flour
* 1 c. milk
* 1/2 c. vegetable stock
* 1/2 tsp. mustard powder
* 1/8 tsp. thyme
* 1/8 tsp. paprika
* 1 c. grated cheese (cheddar, gruyere, or a mozzarella mix)
* salt
* pepper
* chives or other garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°.
2. Brown onions slightly in the butter (about 3 minutes), then add garlic for the usual minute.
3. Whisk in flour and cook for an additional minute.
4. Whisk in milk and stock.
5. Add spices and simmer for another 3 minutes.  Do not boil.
6. Remove from heat and add most of the cheese.
7. In a small, greased baking dish, layer the potatoes alternately with the sauce in 2 or 3 layers.
8. Top with remaining cheese and additional paprika.
9. Cover and bake 25 minutes.
10. Uncover and bake about 35 more minutes until tender.
11. Garnish and serve.

## Variants

Yukon Gold is also recommended for scalloping, while the appropriateness of "waxy" or red potatoes seems highly debated.

Other potential cheeses (besides gruyere, cheddar, or mozzarella) include swiss, gouda, parmesan, asiago, and fontina.

Some prefer a classic 60's dish made with milk alone.
