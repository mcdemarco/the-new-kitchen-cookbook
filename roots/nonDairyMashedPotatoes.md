# Non-Dairy Mashed Potatoes

This recipe was inspired by one I couldn't see behind a paywall, not even after reading acres and acres of meandering and repetitious recipe chat that at least gave away the secret ingredient:  mayonaisse.

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs russet or yukon potatoes, peeled or unpeeled as you prefer
* water to cover
* 2 tsp. salt
* 2 T. mayonaisse
* spices to taste

## Directions

1. Cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces.
2. Put in stockpot with salt and cover with cold tap water.
3. Bring to a boil.
4. Reduce heat and cook 12 minutes or until desired consistency.
5. Reserve cooking water.
6. Mash to desired consistency in pot or an appropriate bowl, adding surprisingly large amounts of the reserved cooking water.  (Beware of curvy bowls that the potatoes leap out of under mashing pressure.)
7. Add mayonaisse.
8. Spice to taste.

## Variants

Other popular non-dairy options include (full-fat) plant milks or olive oil.
