# Roasted Zucchini

Apparently it is possible to succeed at roasting zucchini, although mine got soggy from sitting the first time I tried.

## Ingredients

* 3 zucchini, sliced into 1 inch rounds
* 2 T. olive oil
* 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
* 1 tsp. Sri Lankan roasted curry powder (or other spice mix)

## Directions

1. Slice the zucchini.
2. Mix all ingredients.
3. Arrange in a single layer in a roasting pan.
5. Roast 15 minutes at 450Â°, flipping halfway through.

## Variants

Combine with [roasted potatoes](../roots/roastedPotatoes.md) (during the last 15 minutes).
