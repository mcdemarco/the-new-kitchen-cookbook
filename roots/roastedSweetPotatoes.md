# Roasted Sweet Potatoes

I recently made [Sweet Potato Kale Salad with Cranberries, Walnuts, and Goat Cheese](https://www.queenofmykitchen.com/sweet-potato-kale-salad-with-cranberries-walnuts-and-goat-cheese/) because I happened to have all the ingredients.  I don't expect such a refrigerator conjunction again, but I did like the idea of quickly roasting sweet potato chunks on their own or for mixing into another vegetable.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 lbs sweet potatoes (2 or 3 potatoes)
* 1 T. olive oil
* 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/8 tsp. black pepper
* other spices to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°.
2. Peel and cut the potatoes into 1/2 inch cubes.
3. Toss with other ingredients.
4. Arrange in a single layer on an edged cookie sheet.
5. Roast 12 minutes or to desired tenderness.

## Variants

You can bake whole sweet potatoes in the oven for about an hour at 425° (stabbed and oiled), turning halfway through, or in a crockpot (just washed) for up to 8 hours on low or 4 on high.
