# Roasted Potatoes

This recipe began life as [Garlic Roasted Potatoes](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/garlic-roasted-potatoes-recipe.html) by Ina Garten.  But I think only the absence of garlic merits headline status in a vegetable recipe.

Garlic powder will stick to the potatoes better, but then you won't have any burnt garlic bits left over to snack on.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 lbs red potatoes
* 3 cloves garlic, diced, or 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp. black pepper
* cumin
* paprika

## Directions

1. Cut the potatoes into bite-sized pieces.
2. Mix with garlic, oil, salt, and pepper.
3. Arrange in a single layer in a roasting pan.
4. Sprinkle artfully with cumin and paprika.
5. Roast 45 minutes at 400Â°, stirring halfway through.

## Variants

Combine with [roasted green beans](../vegetables/roastedHaricots.md) or [zucchini](../roots/roastedZucchini.md) for the last 15 minutes.
