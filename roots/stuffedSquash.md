# Couscous Stuffed Squash

I was looking to stuff a butternut squash.  I found some general advice for stuffing butternut, delicata, or acorn squash [at Spend with Pennies](https://www.spendwithpennies.com/stuffed-butternut-squash/), but mostly cut down [this Israeli couscous stuffing](https://littlespicejar.com/stuffed-butternut-squash-curried-couscous-salad/) from The Little Spice Jar, and added some cheese due to demand.  The original quantities are listed under the *serves 6* section.  Serving quantities are approximate for a light meal; for sides you should use the smallest squashes possible (*e.g.* sweet dumpling or small delicatas) and double the number of servings.

## Ingredients (serves 2)

## Directions

1. Cut squash in half and remove seeds.
2. Rub with oil, sugar, and spices.
3. Roast 50 minutes at 425Â° or according to my [roasting winter squash](../roots/squash.md) guide.
4. Meanwhile, in a small pot, toast the couscous in oil with optional onions until the couscous browns somewhat, adding optional garlic at the end.
5. Add liquid and simmer 10 minutes or until absorbed.
6. Meanwhile, mix the dressing and prep the salad ingredients (including optionally toasting the nuts).
7. Fluff couscous and, optionally, let it cool.
8. Dress couscous and add salad ingredients.
9. When the butternut (or other) squash is done, optionally hollow it out further, reserving the squash for another use.
10. Overstuff squash with the couscous salad.

## Variants

Toasting Israeli couscous is optional, but it does look nicer that way (briefly, until you add the curry powder).

The nut specified was pecans, which I don't usually keep around.
