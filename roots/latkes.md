# Latkes

Tori Avery has lots of [latke advice](http://toriavey.com/how-to/2013/11/how-to-make-crispy-latkes/).  This one is based on her [panko version](http://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/2012/11/crispy-panko-potato-latkes/), but cut down a bit.

Makes: 14--16 latkes.

## Ingredients

* 1 2/3 lb. russet potatoes
* 1 medium onion
* 1/2 c. panko
* 2 eggs
* 2 tsp. potato starch (optional)
* salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Peel and grate potatoes into ice water.  Let sit 20 minutes.
2. Grate onion.
3. Remove potatoes to a colander.
4. Squeeze potatoes and onion in a towel or cheesecloth to remove as much liquid as possible.
3. Pour off ice water, reserving the starch.
4. Combine all ingredients (including reserved or extra starch).
5. Squeeze latkes some more into latke-shape, 3 T. at a time.
6. Deep-fry 2--3 minutes per side at 360°--375°.
7. Drain on a rack.

Serve hot with sour cream or applesauce.

## Variants

For sweet potato latkes, reduce to 1 lb. sweet potatoes per 2 eggs, skip the ice water steps, and, optionally, replace panko with 1/3 c. flour.  Optionally add scallions and 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper.  Sweet potatoes can be harder to keep in one piece, so you may want to fry them more shallowly in a frying pan (rather than deep-frying them).

[The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/crispy-cheesy-latkes-recipe-23450999) adds a baked-on cheese topping.  There are also schools of mixing in the cheese, stuffing with cheese, or [going Greek](https://honestcooking.com/spanolatkes-greek-twist-latkes-recipe/).
