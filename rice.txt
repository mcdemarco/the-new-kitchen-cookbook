# Rice

## Rice Salad

This is one of my favorite recipes, but I don't make it very often because of the variety of cans of stuff required.  I adapted it from one of my  favorite cookbooks, *The Book of Jewish Food* by Claudia Roden, mainly by upping my favorite ingredients and making others optional.

### Ingredients

* 1 lb. long-grain rice
* 6 T. olive oil
* 4 T. white wine vinegar
* 16 black olives
* 3 T. capers
* a small or medium jar of quartered marinated artichoke hearts
* 1 or 2 2 oz. cans of anchovies, chopped
* 1 or 2 small cans of tuna, preferably preserved in oil, flaked (optional)
* 16 cherry or grape tomatoes, halved if large
* salt and pepper to taste

### Directions

Make the rice as usual but in extra water, then drain.  Dress with liquids and spices while hot.  Mix in remaining ingredients.  Serve hot or cold.



## Risotto

Risotto is more a style than a recipe; I have a favorite risotto style that I made up myself.  If you don't know what you're doing, though, I suggest starting with a basic mushroom & cheese risotto recipe instead.  Do not substitute anything American for the rice unless you know it works; use Italian arborio rice.

You also need a good pan: either enameled cast iron or a heavy-bottomed stainless steel pan works best.  If you don't have one, you had better know what you're doing.  My risotto pan is a somewhat wok-shaped enameled pan from Mario Batali that works well (but that I don't think they make anymore)--you can see it in some of the pasta pictures.

I have used some nice organic powdered stocks; [Better Than Boullion](http://www.superiortouch.com/retail/products/better-than-bouillon) is also good.

## Tempeh Risotto

I like this one because it can be anything you want it to be: vegan, fowly, cheesy, etc.  Tempeh holds up to cooking the whole time (most risotto ingredients need to be added late in the process), and if it happens to fall apart then it looks just like the rest of the risotto and nobody knows.

### Ingredients

* olive oil
* 1 large leek, medium shallot, or small onion, chopped
* 1-3 cloves garlic, chopped or minced (optional)
* 1/2 slab tempeh (LightLife or Trader Joe's organic tempeh are the right size)
* 1 c. arborio, carnaroli, or vialone nano rice
* 1/4 c. white wine (optional)
* 2 c. or more chicken or vegetable stock
* water to supplement the broth--if you need to soak or blanch an extra, use that water.
* 1/3 c. grated parmesan or romano cheese (optional)
* extras:  peas, chopped asparagus, mushrooms, basil, etc. (optional)

### Directions

Start the stock and water (at least 3 cups total) boiling in a small pot on another burner.  

If you are using an extra like mushrooms that needs some cooking outside of the risotto, fry them in the risotto pan first, then remove.  (Leave any juices behind for the risotto.)

In your good risotto pan, fry the onion-like thing in olive oil at medium heat until transparent.  
Add garlic and fry briefly.
Chop tempeh into small cubes and add to onions.  Fry as patients permits; I have occasionally gotten them to look crispy.

Add more oil if it's disappeared.
Add rice and fry a few minutes until transparent.
Optionally, add wine and fry away.

Now begins the eternal night of the risotto.  Add a small amount of broth to the rice and cook it off.  Keep doing this until the rice is done.  This will take about half an hour; you should add your extras in time for them to get enough cooking or warming up on this schedule.  

If you run low on broth and the rice is still too hard, add more broth or water to the broth pot.  Chicken stock can take some dilution; vegetable stock should probably be supplemented with more vegetable stock, which is simple to do with the powdered stuff or concentrate.

Leave a little broth in the rice at the end to keep it fairly loose.  If you have leftover broth, save it for reheating any leftover risotto.
