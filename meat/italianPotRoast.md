# Italian Pot Roast

This is another option I found for the chunky London Broil cuts that I get from Costco.  It's cut down from Simply Recipe's [Italian Pot Roast](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/italian_pot_roast/) and altered for Passover, ending up as a soupier version of [Baked London Broil](../meat/bakedLondon.md).

## Ingredients

* 2 lb. london broil beef
* 1/2 tsp. salt or to taste
* 1/4 tsp. black pepper
* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 small carrot, diced
* 1 small celery stick, diced
* 1 small onion (optionally red), diced
* 3 cloves garlic, mashed or minced
* 1 tsp. dried parsley (or 1 T. fresh)
* 1 tsp. dried sage (or 1 T. fresh)
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/4 tsp. red pepper (optional)
* 1 1/2 T. beef broth, chicken broth, wine, or soy sauce
* 1 c. red wine
* 1 14 oz. can plum tomatoes


## Directions

1. Sear the meat in the oil in a dutch oven (or any pan if using a crockpot).  Remove.
2. Fry the onions, celery, and carrots for 10 minutes.
3. Optionally, add any fresh herbs and fry for 1 minute.
4. Deglaze the pan with some of the wine.
5. Return the meat to the pan and coat with the vegetable mix.
6. Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.  Optionally transfer to a crockpot before or after this step.
7. Simmer for 3--4 hours, basting every half hour.  (Crockpot on high, or longer on low.)
8. Let sit an additional hour in a warm oven.  (Crockpot on warm.)
9. Optionally, remove the meat and reduce the sauce to the desired consistency ("medium-thick").
10. Slice meat into thick slices, if necessary.

Serve over [polenta](../vegetables/polenta.md).

## Variants

The carrots can be replaced by parsnips, turnips, and/or rutabagas.  Mushrooms are also a nice addition.

The sage can be replaced by thyme.

For more spice than just red pepper, add cayenne pepper and/or Worcestershire sauce.

The original recipe called for more wine, which may need more reduction.  If you want more liquid and/or less wine, use beef broth.

You can make and slice it a day ahead, then reheat.
