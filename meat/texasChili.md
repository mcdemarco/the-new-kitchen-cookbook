# Texas Chili

I cut [Lisa Fein's Seven Chili recipe](http://www.amateurgourmet.com/2011/09/lisa-fains-seven-chile-chili.html) roughly in half for my hunk of meat, and reduced the chili count to 5.  I also omitted the coffee per one of the comments.

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs. chunkable beef, trimmed and cut to 1/4" cubes.
* olive oil
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 16 oz. Guinness
* 1/2 c. water
* 1/2 T. ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp. oregano
* 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
* 1/8 tsp. ground clove
* 1/4 tsp. ground allspice
* 1/4 tsp. cayenne
* 1/4 tsp. grated Mexican chocolate
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more to taste
* 1 T. masa harina (optional)


### Chiles

* 4--5 anchos (3 oz. dried)
* 2 arbols (+1)
* 1 chipotle (+2)
* 2 piquins
* 1/2 c. water

## Directions

1. Stem and seed chiles.
2. Toast all but the piquins in a dry saute pan for about 10 seconds per side (to puff).
3. Add water to cover and bring to a boil.
4. Soak 1/2 hour.
5. Meanwhile, in a heavy pot, brown the beef in the oil.
6. Remove beef and cook onions until translucent.
7. Add garlic briefly, then return beef to pot.
8. Add remaining non-chile ingredients except masa harina, and bring to a boil.
9. Puree all the chiles in the 1/2 c. water.
10. Add puree to pot.
11. Once it's boiling, reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 3--4 hours.
12. Scoop out some broth to combine with masa harina, then add back.
13. Simmer 1/2 hour longer.

## Variants

I added some spare chiles for a second recipe, as noted.  Tortilla chips are supposed to be a good substitute for masa harina, but I ended up skipping that step altogether.
