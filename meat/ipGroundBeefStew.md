# Instant Pot Ground Beef Stew

Based on [Moroccan Beef and Lentils](https://smartnutrition.ca/recipes/moroccan-beef-lentils/), cut down and otherwise altered to suit my pantry.  Also see that recipe for stovetop directions.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 lb. ground beef
* olive oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced or sliced
* fresh ginger to taste
* 1 c. beef broth
* 14 oz. canned tomatoes
* 2 carrots, sliced thin
* 1/2 c. red lentils
* 1 tsp. honey
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp. ground coriander
* 1/2 tsp. cumin
* 1/4 tsp. turmeric
* 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes
* 1/4 tsp. pepper
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 3/4 c. raisins

## Directions

1. Saute the onions in the oil.  Add garlic as usual.
2. Add the ground beef and spices and brown.
3. Cancel saute.
4. Add remaining ingredients.
5. Pressure-cook on high for 5 minutes.
6. Release as you prefer.
7. Serve over rice with a side of vegetables.

## Variants

The original recipe grated the carrot, added the fruit after cooking, used ground ginger rather than fresh, and omitted the red pepper.

It would be handy to cook the vegetables in the stew, if they can hold up under the pressure.
