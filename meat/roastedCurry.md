# Sri Lankan Beef Curry

This recipe is a mix of a couple of Sri Lankan beef curry styles, [Devilled Beef Curry](https://www.theflavorbender.com/sri-lankan-devilled-beef-curry/) and [a coconut milk beef curry](https://www.islandsmile.org/sri-lankan-beef-curry-slow-cooked/) more like my [Sri Lankan coconut chicken curry recipe](../poultry/chickenCurry.md).

Serves 3--4.

## Ingredients

### Marinade

* 1 1/2 lb. chuck beef, cubed
* 3 T. olive oil
* 1/2 T. roasted curry powder
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. black pepper
* 1 stick cinnamon, broken in half
* vinegar and/or soy sauce

### Curry

* 1 1/2 lb. potatoes, cubed
* 1--2 yellow or red onions, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* mild green peppers to taste, chopped
* hot green peppers to taste, chopped
* 1--2 stalks curry leaves (10--20 individual leaves)
* 1 tomato, optional
* 1/4 c. tomato sauce (or tomato paste dissolved in liquid from the beef)
* 1 tsp. roasted curry powder
* 1 tsp. red pepper flakes
* 3/4 c. coconut milk, optional

## Directions

1. Marinate the beef in the marinade spices and oil for up to an hour.
2. Optionally, slow-cook the beef to desired tenderness.  If doing so, add some vinegar or soy sauce for extra liquid.
3. Boil the potatoes separately for 10 minutes.
4. Optionally, brown the beef and remove from the pan.  Leave the juices.  (If the beef was slow-cooked, drain the juices into the pan but remove or leave out the beef.)
5. Stir-fry the remaining vegetables (everything except the curry powder and coconut milk) for 5--10 minutes.
6. If the beef isn't fully cooked, add it and cook 5--10 more minutes.
7. Drain the potatoes, toss them with the curry powder and red pepper flakes, and add them to the pan.  (Remove beef if you need the room.)
8. Fry briefly.
9. Add beef (if it isn't there already) and coconut milk.
10. Simmer until ready to serve.
