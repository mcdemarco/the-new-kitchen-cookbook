# Briskette

Brisket recipes run large but (despite having come from Costco), my brisket was small.  So here's a recipe for a 1 1/2 to 2 lb. brisket, based on a [Wise Sons Jewish Delicatessen recipe](http://www.myrecipes.com/m/recipe/red-wine-onion-braised-brisket) for a 5 lb. brisket.  (The briskettes grew later on, so I recalculated for that.)

## Ingredients

### Small Briskette

* one 1 1/2--2 lb. brisket
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* a generous dash mustard powder (optional)
* a generous dash thyme 
* 1 tsp. brown sugar
* 1--2 T. olive oil
* 1/3 bottle red wine (or replace with 1 c. chicken broth)
* some chicken broth
* 2 cloves garlic, smashed
* 1 onion, diced

### Medium Briskette

* one 2 1/2--3 lb. brisket
* 1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
* 1 tsp. pepper
* 1/2 tsp. mustard powder (optional)
* 1 tsp. dried thyme 
* 1 1/2 tsp. brown sugar
* 1 T. olive oil or schmaltz
* 1/4 bottle red wine (or replace with 1 c. chicken broth)
* 1 1/2 c. chicken broth
* 4 cloves garlic, smashed
* up to 1 lb. onion, sliced thin


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°.
1. Mix the spices and rub into the meat.
2. Brown the beef in the oil for 5 minutes per side, forming a brown crust.
3. Transfer the beef to the smallest baking dish that will fit it.
4. Optionally, fry the onions a bit.
5. Optionally, deglaze the pan with the liquid ingredients.
5. Add liquid ingredients to the beef.
5. Top the beef with the crushed garlic cloves and the onions.  Cover with tin foil.
6. Bake 1 hour.
3. Turn beef over and bake 1 more hour.

## Variants

For a more slow-roasted brisket, reduce heat to 300° and bake about 1 hour per pound.

Add 1/3 to 1/2 lb. carrots, in pieces, and some celery (fry a bit first).

Add 4--6 prunes.

Add tomatoes (optionally crushed).

Marinate the brisket before cooking.

Make it the day before serving and reheat up to an hour in the oven at 300°.

Make it all in a dutch oven, setting the beef on a plate where necessary.

Slice after cooking and then heat in the juices for another 45 minutes.

Serve with horseradish.
