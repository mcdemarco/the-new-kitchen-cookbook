# Briskette

Brisket recipes run large but (despite having come from Costco), my brisket was small.  So here's a recipe for a 1 1/2 to 2 lb. brisket, based on a [Wise Sons Jewish Delicatessen recipe](http://www.myrecipes.com/m/recipe/red-wine-onion-braised-brisket) for a 5 lb. brisket.

## Ingredients

* 1 tsp. salt
* a generous dash mustard powder
* a generous dash thyme 
* 1 tsp. brown sugar (optional)
* 1 1/2--2 lb. brisket
* 1--2 T. olive oil
* 1/3 bottle red wine (or replace with 1 c. chicken broth)
* some chicken broth
* 2 cloves garlic, smashed
* 1 onion, diced


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°.
1. Mix the spices and rub into the meat.
2. Brown the beef in the oil for 5 minutes per side, forming a brown crust.
3. Transfer the beef to the smallest baking dish that will fit it.  Add the liquid ingredients.
4. Optionally, fry the onions a bit.
5. Top the beef with the crushed garlic cloves and the onions.  Cover with tin foil.
6. Bake 1 hour.
3. Turn beef over and bake 1 more hour.

## Variants

For a more slow-roasted brisket, reduce heat to 300° and bake about 1 hour per pound.

Add carrots and celery (fry a bit first).

Add tomatoes (optionally crushed).

Marinate the brisket before cooking.

Make it the day before serving.
