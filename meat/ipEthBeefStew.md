# Instant Pot Ethiopian Beef Stew

Based on TwoSleever's [Ethiopian Beef Stew](https://twosleevers.com/ethiopian-beef-stew/#recipe), cut down a bit.  More alterations happened to the [spice mix](../appetizers/berbere.md).

Serves 2--3.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 lb. ground beef
* 1 1/2 T olive oil
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced or sliced
* 1 1/2 T [berbere](../appetizers/berbere.md)
* 1/3 c. chopped tomatoes (optional)
* 1/2 c. water
* 1/2 tsp. salt

## Directions

1. Sauté the onions, garlic, and berbere in the oil until somewhat dry.
2. Add the ground beef and salt.  Chop it up well and optionally brown it.
3. Cancel sauté.
4. Add remaining ingredients.
5. Pressure-cook on high for 10 minutes.
6. Release naturally.
7. Optionally cook down a bit more on sauté.
8. Optionally serve over your choice of starch with a side of vegetables.

## Variants

I served this with egg noodles and liked it that way, although rice was my first inclination.

It would be handy to cook some vegetables in the stew, if they can hold up under the pressure.

Traditionally this would be made with butter instead of oil.
