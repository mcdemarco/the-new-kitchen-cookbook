# Instant Pot Fried Rice

I cut this down from [this base recipe](https://www.365daysofcrockpot.com/instant-pot-beef-fried-rice/#tasty-recipes-15964-jump-target), with a lot of other changes, some of which I may not have remembered quite right when writing this up.  It was a quick and easy recipe that didn't trigger the burn warning, so I'm sure I'll be ad-libbing it again soon.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 lb. ground beef
* 1 1/3 c. basmati rice
* 1 1/2 c. beef broth
* 1 yellow onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, sliced
* 1--2 green peppers (of any color), chopped
* 1--2 zucchini, halved and sliced
* sesame oil for sauteing
* 1 tsp. salt
* black pepper to taste
* 1/4 tsp. pure chili powder (optional)
* generous dash mustard powder
* dash ground ginger (optional)
* dash [Moroccan spice mix](../appetizers/moroccanSpiceMix.md) (optional)
* dash safflower powder (optional)
* 1--2 T. temari or soy sauce
* 2 T. white wine (optional)

## Directions

1. In the Instant Pot, saute the onions in the oil.  Add the garlic, as usual.
2. Add the ground beef, spices, and temari.  Start browing the beef.  (A spatula is good for chopping it up while browning.)
3. Add the green pepper and zucchini while browning, but don't worry about cooking them thoroughly.
4. Mix in the raw rice.
5. Turn off saute and deglaze as necessary with the wine and broth.
6. Mix well and try to get the rice grains below the level of the broth, or at least wet.
7. Close the vent and the lid.  Cook on high pressure for 3 minutes.
8. Turn off keep warm.
9. Turn off keep warm.
10. Turn off keep warm.
11. Wait ten minutes (of natural release), then release steam.

## Variants

I happened to have fresh veggies around, but the recipe suggests adding frozen peas (1 1/2 c. or so) or other frozen vegetables after release, which makes it even more instant.

The original recipe beat in two eggs at the end, which is not a bad idea.

Fresh ginger is another good addition.
