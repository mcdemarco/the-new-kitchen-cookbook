# Meatballs

![mostly cooked](../images/mostly_cooked.jpg)

This was once the family meatball recipe. It may have been through some game-of-telephone or dumbing down before it came to me. In addition, I removed some ground pork and Romano cheese, and added onion and an extra egg. I made it gluten-free once (when I was out of gluten) by substituting crushed generic rice chex for the bread crumbs.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1/2 cup bread crumbs
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 tsp dried parsley
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 2 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)
* olive oil

## Directions

1. Brown the onion about 8 minutes in olive oil. 
2. Add the garlic for another minute. 
3. Remove onion and garlic from oil and put in a bowl with remaining ingredients. (Leave the pan.)
4. Mix well. 
5. Roll into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter. ![raw](../images/raw.jpg)
6. Brown on all sides in pan. ![browning](../images/browning.jpg)
7. Finish cooking meatballs either in oil or in sauce.
