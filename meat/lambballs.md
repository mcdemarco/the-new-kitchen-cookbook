# Lambballs

This is how I winged some half-beef, half-lamb meatballs.  The spices came from various recipes online.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 lb ground lamb
* 1/2 lb ground lamb or beef
* 1/2 cup panko
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 scant tsp dried mint (or 1 T fresh)
* 1 tsp dried coriander (or 1 T fresh cilantro)
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1/4 tsp cumin
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* dash thyme
* dash parsley
* dash allspice
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 2 tsp nutritional yeast (optional)
* olive oil

## Directions

1. Mix ingredients except olive oil.
2. Form into balls of the desired size (up to 1 inch in diameter).
3. Brown on all sides in the oil.
4. Finish cooking meatballs either in oil, sauce, or wedding soup.

## Variants

Go all lamb!

There are definitely more spices, possibly more salt, and possibly more eggs than necessary, so you could reduce any of them a bit.
