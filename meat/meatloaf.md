# Meatloaf for Passover

I don't recall where I got the original version of this recipe, but I altered it significantly in 2016 under the influence of [Meatloaf Madness](http://www.foodgeeks.com/recipes/meatloaf-madness-18400) (Foodgeeks recipe #18400).

## Ingredients

* 1--2 lbs. ground beef or ground turkey
* 1 onion
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/2 green bell pepper or 1/2 orange, chopped
* 2 matzot crushed or 1 c. matzah farfel or up to 1/2 c. matzah meal
* 1 egg, beaten
* 4 oz. tomato sauce or 1 tomato, chopped (optional; if using, reduce the next ingredient to 1 T.)
* 3 T. water or wine
* 1 tsp. salt

Spices to taste: pepper, basil, cumin, coriander, mustard, paprika, cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, sage

## Directions

1. Optionally, fry the onion, garlic, pepper, orange and/or tomato until soft.  Let cool slightly before mixing in.
2. Mix all ingredients.
3. Put into a (meat)loaf pan, or form into a loaf shape in the center of a baking dish, or 
4. Cook for 1 hour in a preheated 350° - 375° oven.  (Cover if using a baking dish.)

## Variants

Chop some root vegetables and cook them in the pan with the meatloaf.
