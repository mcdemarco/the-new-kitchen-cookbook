# More Meatballs

This is not the [family meatball recipe](../meat/meatballs.md); it's a meat variant of the turkeyballs I usually put in soup, also scaled up for a new size of ground beef from Costco.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 -- 1 1/2 lb ground beef
* 3/4 c. panko
* 3/4 c. diced onion or 1/2 c. minced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/4 tsp dried parsley
* 1 1/4 tsp dried basil
* dash oregano, marjoram, and/or thyme
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1 T. nutritional yeast (optional)
* olive oil

## Directions

1. Optionally brown the diced onion about 8 minutes in olive oil.
2. Add the garlic for another minute, then remove from oil.  (Leave the pan.)
2. Mix all ingredients except oil.
3. Roll into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter.  ![raw](../images/raw.jpg)

5. Finish cooking meatballs either in oil or in sauce.
