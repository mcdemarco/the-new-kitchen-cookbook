# More Meatballs

This is not the [family meatball recipe](../meat/meatballs.md); it's a meat variant of the turkeyballs I usually put in soup, also scaled up for a new size of ground beef from Costco.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 lb ground beef
* 5/8 c. panko
* 1/3 c. onion, minced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/4 tsp dried parsley
* 1 1/4 tsp basil
* dash oregano, marjoram, and/or thyme
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1 T. nutritional yeast (optional)
* olive oil

## Directions

Brown the onion about 8 minutes in olive oil. Add the garlic for another minute. Remove onion and garlic from oil and put in a bowl with remaining ingredients. (Leave the pan on the heat.) Mix well. Roll into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter.
