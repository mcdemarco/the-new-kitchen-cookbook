# Baked London Broil

Most London Broil recipes treat it the cut like a steak, but I tend to get chunky ones from Costco that don't cook through well and might be sitting around waiting for the seder to get to the good (eating) part, so I was looking for more of a long bake.   I found a recipe for a 3--5 lb. cut [at Genius Kitchen](http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/guaranteed-winner-london-broil-159268), that I cut down to 2 lb. or so and altered for Passover.  The end result is not unlike my briskette recipe.

## Ingredients

* 2 lb. london broil beef
* 2 T. olive oil
* 2 T. plus 2 tsp. apple cider vinegar
* 1 1/2 T. beef broth, chicken broth, wine, or soy sauce
* 1 onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, mashed or minced
* 1 1/2 T. brown sugar
* 1/4 tsp. black pepper
* 1 tsp. salt (omit if using soy sauce)
* a generous dash thyme (optional)


## Directions

1. Optionally, fry the onions a bit.
2. Mix all ingredients in a meat-sized container.
3. Marinate the meat in them overnight.
4. Preheat the oven to 400°.
5. Optionally broil or brown the meat before baking.
6. Transfer the beef and marinade to the smallest baking dish that will fit it.
7. Bake 1 hour (1/2 hour per pound).

## Variants

The original recipe called for soy sauce instead of broth.

It permitted shorter marination times, but required a bag.  In that case you might want to make it a day before serving.  Another option is to cut it up after the first cook and reheat in slices.

For slow-roasting, reduce heat to 300° and bake about 1 hour per pound.
