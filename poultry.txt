## Chicken

Chicken is good base on which to express my cooking principle that everything is better with coriander.

### Chicken Cacciatore

I got this recipe from _Cucina Ebraica: Flavors of the Italian Jewish Kitchen_, by Joyce Goldstein, but it's also available [online](http://www.cyber-kitchen.com/rfcj/ITALIAN/Poultry_Chicken_Ezekiels_-_meat.html). The changes I tend to make are using whole, unpitted oil-cured olives in place of the chopped pitted ones (from a similar recipe in another cookbook), onions, and/or random quantities of dried spices in place of the fresh ones.

#### Ingredients

* 3-to-4-pound fryer chicken, cut into serving pieces 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste [nooooo!]
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/3 cup pitted black olives, coarsely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage, plus extra for garnish (optional)
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, plus extra for garnish (optional)
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, plus extra for garnish (optional)
* 1/2 cup dry red wine

#### Directions

Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Warm the olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the chicken pieces and saute until golden on all sides. Add the olives, garlic, tomatoes and sage, rosemary and basil (if using). Cover, reduce heat to low and cook until the chicken is tender, about 25 minutes. Uncover the pan and add the red wine. Raise the heat to high and cook rapidly to reduce the pan juices. Adjust the seasonings. Transfer to a large warmed platter and sprinkle with more fresh herbs, if desired. Serve at once.

### Turkey Chicken

"Turkey Chicken" a.k.a. "Fake Turkey" is a turkey drumstick recipe that I make with chicken drumsticks instead. The original recipe was "Pot-Roasted Turkey Drumsticks" from _The Italian Jewish Kitchen_ by Edda Servi Machlin. Other alterations to the recipe involve drastic shortening of the marinating period, significantly less oil, and boiling during the simmering step. I usually cut the recipe in half.  Once, I served it with spaghetti squash.

#### Directions

Roll 3 1/2 to 4 pounds of chicken legs in a mixture of 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1 teaspoon dried sage, a dash of nutmeg, and 1-3 crushed garlic cloves. I do this all in a big tupperware container, then pour on about a third of a cup of olive oil. Marinate until you're hungry or out of time, then brown them. Cook at medium heat, stirring frequently, for 20 more minutes. Add half a cup of white cooking wine. Reduce until you're really hungry, then serve.

### Turkey Chicken for a Crowd

I multiplied my turkey chicken recipe by three for a big Seder and baked it instead of frying. 

#### Ingredients

* 10-12 lbs. small chicken pieces (legs, thighs, etc.)
* olive oil
* 3 T salt
* 1 T dried rosemary
* 1 T dried sage
* 1 T dried marjoram
* 3-6 chopped garlic cloves
* 1/2 c. white vermouth

#### Directions

Mix the salt, garlic, and spices. Roll the chicken in the mixture. Pack well in a container or plastic bag and coat with olive oil. Marinate for an hour or more in the fridge. Brown in a frying pan. Bake in large baking dish at 475 degrees until done--about 45 minutes.

### Roasted Chicken Quarters with Butternut Squash

This is the first recipe I entered directly into Penflip.  It's a combination of various baked chicken/squash recipies Google spit out, along with a Moroccan chicken and squash stew.  It was inspired by a two pound package of diced butternut squash from Costco.

#### Ingredients

* 3 chicken back quarters
* 1 lb diced butternut squash
* 8 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* 1/2 c. walnuts (optional)
* olive oil
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp coriander (or 1 T. fresh cilantro)
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground clove
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

#### Directions

1. Mix spices.  Rub chicken with oil and some of the spice.  Lay out in a baking dish skin side up.  
2. Coat squash with oil and remaining spice, and mix in walnuts.  Scatter squash-walnut mixture among chicken.
3. Optionally, cover and refrigerate until dinnertime.
4. Bake at 450 degrees for 45 minutes or until done.

## Turkey

### Turkey Scaloppini

This recipe was adapted from Scaloppini di Tacchino Rebecca in _Cucina Ebraica_ by Joyce Goldstein. I cut back on the wine and added specific measurements for the flour mixture. The recipe allows chicken breast meat instead, but I haven't tried that yet. I tossed in some leftover flour mixture rather than thickening the sauce longer, but it's still more liquid than you'd expect.

#### Ingredients

* 1 lb turkey tenders scant
* 1/4 c. flour
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. pepper
* other spices to taste
* 2 T. olive oil scant
* 1/4 c. chopped parsley
* scant 1/4 c. chopped scallion
* 2/3 c. white wine
* scant 2 T. lemon juice

#### Directions

If turkey tenders are much more than 2/3" thick, slice to 2/3" thickness. Place between sheets of plastic wrap and beat with a meat tenderizer to 1/3" thickness. Dredge lightly in a mixture of the flour, salt, and spices. Fry in oil for 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan and keep warm. Add wine to pan and cook down somewhat. Add remaining ingredients and cook for 3 minutes. Pour over turkey and serve.
