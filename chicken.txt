## Roasted Chicken Quarters with Butternut Squash

This is my first Penflip-only recipe.  It is a wacky combination of various chicken and squash recipies Google spit out, and was inspired by a package of diced butternut squash from Costco.

### Ingredients

* 3-4 chicken back quarters
* 1 lb diced butternut squash
* 8 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* walnuts (optional)
* olive oil

* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp coriander (or 1 T. fresh cilantro)
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground clove
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

### Directions

1. Mix spices.  Rub chicken with oil and some of the spice.  Lay out in a baking dish skin side up.  Coat squash with oil and remaining spice.  Scatter among chicken.
2. Optionally, cover and refrigerate until dinnertime.
3. Bake at 450 degrees for 45 minutes or until done.
