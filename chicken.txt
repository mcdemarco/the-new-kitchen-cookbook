# Chicken

Chicken is good base on which to express my cooking principle that everything is better with coriander.

## Chicken Cacciatore

I got this recipe from _Cucina Ebraica: Flavors of the Italian Jewish Kitchen_, by Joyce Goldstein, but it's also available [online](http://www.cyber-kitchen.com/rfcj/ITALIAN/Poultry_Chicken_Ezekiels_-_meat.html). The changes I tend to make are using whole, unpitted oil-cured olives in place of the chopped pitted ones (from a similar recipe in another cookbook), onions, and/or random quantities of dried spices in place of the fresh ones.

### Ingredients

* 3-to-4-pound fryer chicken, cut into serving pieces 
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste [nooooo!]
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/3 cup pitted black olives, coarsely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded and coarsely chopped
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage, plus extra for garnish (optional)
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, plus extra for garnish (optional)
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil, plus extra for garnish (optional)
* 1/2 cup dry red wine

### Directions

Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Warm the olive oil in a large saute pan over high heat. Add the chicken pieces and saute until golden on all sides. Add the olives, garlic, tomatoes and sage, rosemary and basil (if using). Cover, reduce heat to low and cook until the chicken is tender, about 25 minutes. Uncover the pan and add the red wine. Raise the heat to high and cook rapidly to reduce the pan juices. Adjust the seasonings. Transfer to a large warmed platter and sprinkle with more fresh herbs, if desired. Serve at once. 

## Roasted Chicken Quarters with Butternut Squash

This is the first recipe I entered directly into Penflip.  It's a combination of various baked chicken/squash recipies Google spit out, along with a Moroccan chicken and squash stew.  It was inspired by a two pound package of diced butternut squash from Costco.

### Ingredients

* 3 chicken back quarters
* 1 lb diced butternut squash
* 8 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* 1/2 c. walnuts (optional)
* olive oil
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp coriander (or 1 T. fresh cilantro)
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground clove
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

### Directions

1. Mix spices.  Rub chicken with oil and some of the spice.  Lay out in a baking dish skin side up.  
2. Coat squash with oil and remaining spice, and mix in walnuts.  Scatter squash-walnut mixture among chicken.
3. Optionally, cover and refrigerate until dinnertime.
4. Bake at 450 degrees for 45 minutes or until done.
