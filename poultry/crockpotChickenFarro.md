# Crockpot Chicken with Farro

Adapted from several crockpot chicken with farro recipes.  The [one that first inspired me](https://www.thespruce.com/slow-cooker-chicken-with-farro-3994968) came from [The Spruce's large crockpot chicken collection](https://www.thespruce.com/favorite-slow-cooker-chicken-recipes-3054984), but it seemed low on both liquid and stars (and I had no mushrooms) so I adapted.  The peas in particular came from [this non-crockpot recipe](http://www.cookinglight.com/recipes/one-pot-chicken-farro).

## Ingredients

* 4--6 chicken thighs
* 1 c. farro
* 1 small to medium onion, chopped
* 5 cloves garlic, whole
* 2 1/4 c. water
* 2 chicken or mushroom broth cubes, or one of each
* 2 stalks celery, chopped
* 1/2 of an Italian sausage, thinly sliced (optional)
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 bay leaf
* pepper
* red pepper
* cumin
* sage
* mustard seed
* dash nutmeg
* 2 c. frozen peas

## Directions

1. Combine all ingredients except peas in crockpot.
2. Cook on low 6 hours.
3. Cook peas separately, then mix in.

## Variants

The sausage is my own invention.

The crockpot recipes called for lots of mushrooms or bell pepper rather than the peas.
