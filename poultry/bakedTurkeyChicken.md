# Turkey Chicken for a Crowd

I multiplied my turkey chicken recipe by three for a big Seder and baked it instead of frying. 

## Ingredients

* 10-12 lbs. small chicken pieces (legs, thighs, etc.)
* olive oil
* 3 T salt
* 1 T dried rosemary
* 1 T dried sage
* 1 T dried marjoram
* 3-6 chopped garlic cloves
* 1/2 c. white vermouth

## Directions

Mix the salt, garlic, and spices. Roll the chicken in the mixture. Pack well in a container or plastic bag and coat with olive oil. Marinate for an hour or more in the fridge. Brown in a frying pan. Bake in large baking dish at 475 degrees until done--about 45 minutes.
