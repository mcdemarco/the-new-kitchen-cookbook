# Turkey Chicken for a Crowd

I multiplied my [turkey chicken recipe](../poultry/turkeyChicken.md) by three for a big Seder and baked it instead of frying. 

## Ingredients

* 10--12 lbs. small chicken pieces (legs, thighs, etc.)
* olive oil
* 3 T salt
* 1 T dried rosemary
* 1 T dried sage
* 1 T dried marjoram
* 3--6 chopped garlic cloves
* 1/2 c. white vermouth

## Directions

1. Mix the salt, garlic, and spices.
2. Roll the chicken in the mixture.
3. Pack well in a container or plastic bag and coat with olive oil. Marinate in the fridge for an hour or overnight.
4. Brown in a frying pan.
5. Bake with the wine in large baking pan at 475° until done--about 45 minutes.

## Variants

Replace dried spices with fresh (3 T. each).

If you don't have the time or facilities to brown that much chicken on the stovetop, you can try broiling it in the oven or do this:

1. Spread the chicken out in a single layer, skin side up, in several baking pans.
2. Bake in a convection oven at 425° for 15 minutes.
3. Turn down to 375° and bake for 20 more minutes.
4. Baste and sprinkle with wine.
5. Continue baking until the chicken is done (about 20 more minutes, depending on the size of the pieces).

This method produces a lot of liquid, which you should mostly set aside for later use.
