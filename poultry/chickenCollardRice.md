# Chicken with Collards and Rice

I'm always on the lookout for things to do with my favorite cut of chicken: boneless chicken thighs.  This is recipe is an altered version of Chicken-and-Collards Pilau from [Southern Living](http://www.southernliving.com/meat/chicken/chicken-collards-rice-pilau-recipe-video) by way of [myrecipes](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-collards-pilau).  I found it strangely difficult to follow; also I didn't believe the rice quantities, and I didn't have the extra veggies on hand.   I did have some vegan sausage I wanted to use up, and I ran out of basmati and had to use half sushi rice.

Serves 3--6.

## Ingredients

* 6 oz. vegetarian or real sausage
* 1 1/4 lbs. boneless chicken thighs, cut bite-sized
* olive oil and/or chicken fat
* 1 yellow onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. black pepper
* 1/2 tsp. dried coriander (optional)
* 2 cubes frozen fresh coriander (optional)
* 3 c. chicken or other broth
* 4 c. chopped collards (packed)
* 1 1/2 c. white rice
* 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes (heaping)

## Directions

1. Fry the onions in the oil or fat in a dutch oven.
2. Add garlic and fry briefly.
2. Add sausage and more fat if needed, and cook 5--10 minutes, depending on package instructions.
3. Remove sausage but not fat from pan.
3. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
4. Add chicken, more fat if needed, and all spices except red pepper.  Fry until it looks cooked.
5. Return sausage to pan.
6. Add broth and bring to a boil.
6. Add all remaining ingredients (collards, rice, red pepper).  Return to a boil.
7. Cover and bake 20 minutes, stirring at 10 minutes.

## Variants

The original recipe included a cup of chopped celery and a cup of chopped carrots.  I didn't miss either, though I might shred some carrots next time for color.

If replacing collards with kale, note that kale doesn't pack as tightly and increase quantities accordingly.
