# Crockpot Chicken Legs

Adapted from several crockpot chicken recipes, especially TAK's [Crock Pot Chicken Legs](https://www.theanthonykitchen.com/crock-pot-chicken-legs/) and [previous crockpot recipes](../poultry/crockpotRoastedChicken.md).   It's useful for when I have a Costco quantity of chicken legs hanging around the fridge.

## Ingredients

* about 2 1/2 lbs (7) chicken legs, thawed
* olive oil to coat
* 2 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp. onion powder
* 1 tsp. smoked paprika
* dash cayenne pepper
* dash black pepper
* dash thyme
* dash basil
* dash oregano

## Directions

1. Dry chicken pieces and toss with olive oil in crockpot.
2. Combine spices and rub onto chicken.
3. Cook on high 2--3 hours, depending on crockpot.

## Variants

The original recipe went for 3 1/2--4 hours on low.

As usual, you can broil the chicken to crisp it up after cooking.

Put three or four thighs skin down in the crockpot and sprinkle with the spices.  No drying, oil, or rubbing is necessary.
