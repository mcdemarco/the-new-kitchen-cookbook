# Roasted Chicken Thighs with Sweet Potatoes

This recipe is based on Eating Well's [Roast Chicken & Sweet Potatoes](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250549/roast-chicken-sweet-potatoes/).  I divided it up into something more legible, added several more accoutrements, and changed the baking directions.

## Ingredients

### Chicken

* 4 bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 lbs)
* 2 T. whole-seed (prepared) mustard
* 1 T. Japanese spicy mayo
* 1 T. olive oil
* 1 tsp. thyme or to taste
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. black pepper


### Sweet Potatoes

* 4 smallish sweet potatoes, peeled and cubed
* 1 mild onion, chunked (optional)
* 1 T. olive oil
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. black pepper
* paprika to taste
* garlic powder to taste


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450Â° (with convection).
2. Mix the chicken ingredients and rub into the chicken.  Lay out in a baking dish skin side up.
3. Bake chicken about 10 minutes.
4. In the meantime, mix the sweet potato spices and toss with the oil and vegetables.
5. Remove chicken from oven and lift thighs individually to add sweet potatoes underneath the chicken.  
6. Bake for 30 more minutes or until done.
