# Turkey or Chicken a la King

After the turkey, there is the leftover turkey (and, more rarely, leftover gravy).  Here's something more exciting than reheating or sandwiches to do with it.  Recipes vary wildly; this one is a simpler, kosherer amalgamation of several varieties.

## Ingredients

### Solids

* olive oil
* 1 small yellow onion, chopped
* 1/4 green pepper, chopped (optional)
* 6 haricots (green beans), sliced (optional)
* 6 oz. fresh mushrooms, sliced
* 1 c. peas
* 3--4 c. cubed leftover turkey or chicken
* 12 oz. package egg noodles

### Roux

* 4 T flour
* 1 c. almond or other non-dairy milk
* 1 c. chicken broth or water
* 1/4 c. cooking wine
* 1 c. or so leftover gravy (optional)
* 1 tsp. dried parsely
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. pepper
* generous dash thyme
* dash nutmeg
* dash cayenne pepper
* dash assafroa (optional)


## Directions

1. Warm peas separately if frozen.
2. Prepare egg noodles according to package directions.
2. In a large saucepan, fry the onions in the olive oil until soft.
3. Add any green pepper, haricots, or decorative veggies and cook in the oil.
4. Add mushrooms and cook down.
5. Fish out veggies and set aside.  (It's okay to leave some onions behind.)
6. Replenish oil if necessary to about 3 T.
7. Whisk in the flour and cook for 2 minutes.
8. Whisk in broth and wine.
9. Add spices.
10. Simmer from 0-15 minutes as your schedule allows.
11. Incorporate leftover gravy.
12. Add veggies (including peas) and meat.
13. Heat through.  Serve over noodles.

## Variants

Carrots are sometimes seen, and/or much more green pepper in place of the peas.
