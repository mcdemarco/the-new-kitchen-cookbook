# Turkey Scaloppini

This recipe was adapted from Scaloppini di Tacchino Rebecca in _Cucina Ebraica_ by Joyce Goldstein. I cut back on the wine and added specific measurements for the flour mixture. I tossed in some leftover flour mixture rather than thickening the sauce longer, but it's still more liquid than you might expect.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb turkey tenders scant
* 1/4 c. flour
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. pepper
* other spices to taste
* 2 T. olive oil scant
* 1/4 c. chopped parsley
* scant 1/4 c. chopped scallion
* 2/3 c. white wine
* scant 2 T. lemon juice

## Directions

If turkey tenders are much more than 2/3" thick, slice to 2/3" thickness. Place between sheets of plastic wrap and beat with a meat tenderizer to 1/3" thickness. Dredge lightly in a mixture of the flour, salt, and spices. Fry in oil for 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan and keep warm. Add wine to pan and cook down somewhat. Add remaining ingredients and cook for 3 minutes. Pour over turkey and serve.

## Variants

The recipe allows chicken breast meat instead, but I haven't tried that yet.
