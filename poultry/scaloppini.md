# Turkey Scaloppini

This recipe was adapted from Scaloppini di Tacchino Rebecca in _Cucina Ebraica_ by Joyce Goldstein. I cut back on the wine and added specific measurements for the flour mixture. I tossed in some leftover flour mixture rather than thickening the sauce longer, but it's still more liquid than you might expect.

## Ingredients

* 1 scant lb turkey tenders (about 4 pieces)
* 1/4 c. flour
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. pepper
* other spices to taste
* 2 T. olive oil scant
* 1/4 c. chopped parsley
* scant 1/4 c. chopped scallion
* 2/3 c. white wine
* scant 2 T. lemon juice

## Directions

If turkey tenders are much more than 2/3" thick, slice to 2/3" thickness. Place between sheets of plastic wrap and beat with a meat tenderizer to 1/3" thickness. Dredge lightly in a mixture of the flour, salt, and spices. Fry in oil for 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan and keep warm. Add wine to pan and cook down somewhat. Add remaining ingredients and cook for 3 minutes. Pour over turkey and serve.

## Variants

The recipe allows chicken breast meat instead, but I haven't tried that yet.

[For Passover](http://archive.jsonline.com/features/food/passover-recipes-neednt-sacrifice-flavor-gj951ub-198834501.html), you can pre-coat the turkey tenders in 1/4 c. rice (warning: kitniyot), almond, or matzah cake flour (mixed with the spices), dunk in egg (mixed with the salt), and coat with matzah meal.

You can top with young Japanese knotweed shoots instead of scallion.

You can steam seasoned turkey tenders in an Instant Pot.  The internet generally recommends you do it on the trivet (which I find dries them out) over a cup of water or broth, on high pressure for 20 minutes with a quick release.  Optionally you can saute them first; reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes.  If you cook them from frozen increase the time to 30 minutes.  I would cook them directly in broth instead.  You don't need to tenderize them first, but the trivet (or a steamer basket) doesn't fit more than two or three in a 6 quart pot, and even without it you probably can't fit more than four.
