# Cranberry Sauce

It's not a vegetable and it might get lost in the sweets, so I put my cranberry sauce recipe in with poultry.  Cranberry sauce is very forgiving, and I pretty much made this one up as I went along.

## Ingredients

Fresh cranberries come in an inconvenient package, so for one of those see the second ingredients list.

### 1 Pound

* 1 lb cranberries, fresh or frozen
* a handful of pitted cherries, dark, sweet, or mixed, fresh or frozen (optional)
* 1 1/4 c. water
* 2 c. sugar
* zest and juice of one lime (optional)
* dash cinnamon (optional)
* dash clove (optional)
* dash nutmeg (optional)
* dash ginger (optional)
* dash allspice (optional)

### 1 Package

* 12 oz. cranberries, fresh or frozen
* 1 c. apple cider or water
* 1 1/2 c. sugar (1 c. if using cider)
* 1 1/2 T. lime juice (optional)
* dash cinnamon (optional)
* dash clove (optional)
* dash nutmeg (optional)
* dash ginger (optional)
* dash allspice (optional)

## Directions

1. Mix sugar, water or cider, cranberries, and (optional) cherries in a small stock pot.
2. Cook on low until the cranberries start popping.
3. Add any remaining ingredients (they're all optional).
4. Cook 15 more minutes or until adequately thickened.
5. Serve chilled.

## Variants

I'm not a smooth cranberry sauce fan, but if you want it smooth you can immersion blend the cranberries with some of the water, preferably before cooking.

Besides apple cider, I've seen orange or pineapple juice recommended as the liquid.

You can make cranberry sauce in an instant pot, but because not much water is required, you would need to make a bigger batch than I usually do, or use a smaller instant pot that I have.  See [Damn Delicious](https://damndelicious.net/2019/11/19/instant-pot-cranberry-sauce/) for details.
