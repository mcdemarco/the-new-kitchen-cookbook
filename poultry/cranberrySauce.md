# Cranberry Sauce

It's not a vegetable and it might get lost in the sweets, so I put my cranberry sauce recipe in with poultry.  Cranberry sauce is very forgiving, and I pretty much made this one up as I went along.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb cranberries, fresh or frozen
* a handful of pitted cherries, dark, sweet, or mixed, fresh or frozen (optional)
* 2 c. sugar
* 1 1/4 c. water
* zest and juice of one lime (optional)
* dash cinnamon (optional)
* dash clove (optional)
* dash nutmeg (optional)
* dash ginger (optional)
* dash allspice (optional)

## Directions

1. Mix sugar, water, cranberries, and (optional) cherries in a small stock pot.
2. Cook on low until the cranberries start popping.
3. Add any remaining ingredients (they're all optional).
4. Cook 15 more minutes or until adequately thickened.
5. Serve chilled.

## Variants

I'm not a smooth cranberry sauce fan, but if you want it smooth you can immersion blend the cranberries with some of the water, preferably before cooking.
