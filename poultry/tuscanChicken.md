# Tuscan Chicken with Olives and Capers

This is a combination of [two](http://leitesculinaria.com/81989/recipes-roast-chicken-pancetta-olives.html) [recipes](http://hungrydomaine.com/index.php/2014/06/18/no-time-to-cook-roasted-chicken-with-black-olives-capers-and-rosemary/) I found online in a search for chicken with black olives and possibly capers.  They went through the usual process of adjustment:  fewer squirrels (rabbits, in this case), less forethought/marinating, and more spices.

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs. chicken legs and or thighs
* 2 T olive oil
* 1/2 tsp dried thyme
* 1 tsp fresh rosemary
* 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (heaping)
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp sea salt
* 3 cloves garlic, whole
* 1/3 c. white wine
* 1-2 T capers
* 12 Kalamata olives, optionally pitted and quartered
* 2 T balsamic vinegar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450Â°.
2. Rub the chicken with a mix of the salt, spices, and oil (or sprinkle the oil on separately).
3. Put chicken and garlic in a baking dish or deep baking sheet, skin-side up if it has sides.  Roast 20 minutes.
5. Sprinkle with wine and vinegar and roast 8 more minutes.
6. Scatter olives and capers in dish and roast 15-20 more minutes until sufficiently crispy looking.
7. Let rest 10 minutes before serving.
