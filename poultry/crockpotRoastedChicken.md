# Crockpot Roasted Chicken

Adapted from several crockpot-a-whole-chicken-dry recipes, especially [The Little Kitchen's](https://www.thelittlekitchen.net/whole-chicken-in-a-slow-cooker/).   Like the others it was for a much bigger chicken than the one in my freezer, so I cut it down.  Double it back up for a 3--4 lb. chicken.

## Ingredients

* 1 2lb whole chicken
* 5 cloves garlic, lightly smashed
* 1 onion, sliced thick
* 1 lemon, quartered (optional)
* celery, optional
* carrots, optional
* potato, optional, diced

### Rub

* 2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. paprika
* 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp. thyme
* 1/4 tsp. black pepper
* 1/4 tsp. garlic powder

## Directions

1. Combine rub ingredients and rub chicken.
2. Optionally stuff chicken with lemon and some garlic cloves.
3. Place any onion, celery, carrots, and remaining cloves in the bottom of the crockpot.
4. Place chicken on top of onion layer.
5. Optionally fill edges with potato.
6. Cook on low 4--6 hours, depending on crockpot.

Serve.

## Variants

The potatoes are my own addition.  I have also added a bulb of fennel and fava beans (removing the carrots).

Optionally, you can broil chicken to crisp it up after cooking.
