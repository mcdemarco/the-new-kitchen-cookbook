# Crockpot Roasted Chicken

Adapted from several crockpot-a-whole-chicken-dry recipes, especially [The Little Kitchen's](https://www.thelittlekitchen.net/whole-chicken-in-a-slow-cooker/).   Like the others it was for a much bigger chicken than the one in my freezer, so I cut it down.  Double it back up for a 3--4 lb. chicken.

It's especially handy for hot summer days when you don't want to heat up the whole kitchen to roast a chicken [the normal way](../poultry/roasted.md).

## Ingredients

* 1 2lb whole chicken, fully thawed
* 5 cloves garlic, lightly smashed
* 1 onion, sliced thick
* 1 lemon, quartered (optional)
* celery, optional
* carrots, optional
* potato, optional, diced

### Rub

* 2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. smoked paprika
* 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp. thyme
* 1/4 tsp. black pepper
* 1/4 tsp. garlic powder

## Directions

1. Combine rub ingredients and rub onto chicken.
2. Optionally stuff chicken with lemon and some garlic cloves.
3. Place any onion, celery, carrots, and remaining cloves in the bottom of the crockpot.
4. Place chicken on top of onion layer.
5. Optionally fill edges with potato.
6. Cook on low 4--6 hours, depending on crockpot and chicken size.

## Variants

The potatoes are my own addition.  I have also added a bulb of fennel (to the onion/celery layer) and substituted sweet potatoes for the potatoes.

The original recipe has a [lemon pepper variant](https://www.thelittlekitchen.net/lemon-pepper-roast-chicken-in-a-slow-cooker/).

Optionally, you can broil chicken to crisp it up after cooking.

Some speed up the process by cooking the chicken on high, but I haven't tried it since it's pretty quick as it is.
