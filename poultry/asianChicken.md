# Spicy Asian Chicken

This is cut down from Emeril's recipe [Alain's Sweet and Spicy Asian Drumsticks](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/alains-sweet-and-spicy-asian-drumsticks-recipe.html), which included a crazy amount of glaze.  I made the entire spice mix, but for future reference I've cut that down, too.

## Ingredients

### Glaze

* 2/3 c. orange juice
* 1/3 c. pineapple juice
* 2 tsp. zest
* 2 tsp. garlic, minced
* 2 tsp. scallion, minced
* 1 tsp. sesame oil
* 1/6 c. soy sauce
* 1/6 c. mirin
* 1/3 c. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes

### Spice

If you have Essence of Emeril (his Creole seasoning) already prepared, use 2 T.

* 1 1/4 tsp paprika
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp pepper
* 1/2 tsp onion powder (optional; I substituted dried chives)
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp thyme

### Chicken

* 6--8 chicken legs or thighs
* salt
* 1 tsp. sesame seeds, optionally toasted
* fresh cilantro for garnish (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°.
2. Boil the glaze for about 20 minutes to a thick syrup.
3. Rub the chicken pieces with the spice mix and the additional salt, and lay out in a casserole.
4. Pour a good coating of glaze over the chicken.  Reserve remaining glaze.
5. Bake for 40--55 minutes, depending on the size of the pieces, optionally reglazing partway through.
6. If your sesame seeds are untoasted and/or your cilantro is dried, sprinkle them on near the end of the cooking time.  (Otherwise, garnish after cooking.)
7. Serve with remaining glaze.
