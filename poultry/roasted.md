# Roasted Whole Chicken

I roast chicken according to the 1942 Good Housekeeping Cookbook: 50 minutes per pound at 325°, oiled and covered with cheesecloth (or just the oil, if you don't mind spattering the whole oven with chicken grease).  Cut out 7 minutes per pound for chickens over 4 lbs., and 14 per pound for chickens over 5 lbs.

You're supposed to use a wire rack in the roasting pan; I sometimes use a broiler pan.

## Variants

Sometimes you don't want to wait the entire 50 minutes a pound.  At one of those times, I tried [a quick-cooking recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/moist-roasted-whole-chicken-330734) for a 3 lb. chicken that involved rubbing the chicken with olive oil and encrusting it with an unexpectedly large amount of spices (much more than in their picture), roasting it at 450° for 20 minutes, and then turning it down to 400° for 40 more minutes.  There was no rack, and at some point tin foil was necessary to keep the top from burning.

The spice mixture was: 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil, 1 tsp. paprika.  Peter liked the crusty effect.
