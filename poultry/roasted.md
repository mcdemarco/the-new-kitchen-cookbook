# Roasted Whole Bird

## Chicken

I roast chicken according to the 1942 Good Housekeeping Cookbook: 50 minutes per pound at 325째, oiled and covered with cheesecloth (or just the oil, if you don't mind spattering the whole oven with chicken grease).  Cut out 7 minutes per pound for chickens over 4 lbs., and 14 per pound for chickens over 5 lbs.

You're supposed to use a wire rack in the roasting pan; I sometimes use a broiler pan or nothing instead.

## Turkey

I roast turkey according to [Wegman's directions](https://www.wegmans.com/products/kosher/kosher-meat/turkey/turkey.html):  3 1/2 hours for a 12 lb. turkey, which actually turned out to be 3 3/4 hours for a 12 1/4 lb. turkey, but it was fine.  (The Good Housekeeping rule is 20 minutes per pound at 300째.)  Let sit 20 minutes before carving.

I stick a quartered onion in the middle instead of stuffing the bird (add 50 minutes for actual stuffing), but still tie up the legs and tail.  You can rub the skin with oil and cover the bird with cheesecloth as for chicken.

To make gravy, toast 2--3 T. flour (or more, depending on the dripping quantity or the availability of broth) in a saucepan.  Pour out someplace safe, then strain the oil off the top of the drippings into the pan, heat as necessary, and whisk the flour back in for a minute or two.  Add remaining drippings.  Add some broth or water to extend the gravy, if desired.

## Variants

Sometimes you don't want to wait the entire 50 minutes a pound.  At one of those times, I tried [a quick-cooking recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/moist-roasted-whole-chicken-330734) for a 3 lb. chicken that involved rubbing the chicken with olive oil and encrusting it with an unexpectedly large amount of spices (much more than in their picture), roasting it at 450째 for 20 minutes, and then turning it down to 400째 for 40 more minutes.  There was no rack, and at some point tin foil was necessary to keep the top from burning.

The spice mixture was: 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 1/2 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. basil, 1 tsp. paprika.  Peter liked the crusty effect.

Sometimes you don't want to heat up or dirty up the oven.  At those times, I roast the chicken [in a crockpot](../poultry/crockpotRoastedChicken.md) instead.  Allegedly this works for a turkey, too, but I've never personally seen either a turkey that would fit into a crockpot or a crockpot that would fit a whole turkey.
