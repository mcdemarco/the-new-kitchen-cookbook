# Roasted Whole Chicken

I roast chicken according to the 1942 Good Housekeeping Cookbook: 50 minutes per pound at 325Â°, covered with a greased cheesecloth (or just a bit of oil, if you don't mind spattering the whole oven with chicken grease).  Cut out 7 minutes per pound for chickens over 4 lbs., and 14 per pound for chickens over 5 lbs.

You're supposed to use a wire rack in the roasting pan; if I ever acquire one I'll try it that way.
