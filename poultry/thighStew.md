# Moroccan Spiced Chicken Stew

I found this recipe [online](http://www.anediblemosaic.com/?p=4167) when looking for something soupy to do with boneless chicken thighs.  I added a green pepper from some other recipe because I only had a couple of little red potatoes instead of the yukons, and substituted two Ancho chiles for the cayenne pepper (one would have been plenty).  I also omitted the garnish (parsley, if you must).

## Ingredients

* about 1 lb boneless chicken thighs, plus flour for dredging
* 2 T olive oil
* 2 onions, diced
* 1 bay leaf
* 3/4 tsp. turmeric
* 3/4 tsp. cumin
* 3/4 tsp. paprika
* 1/4 tsp. allspice
* 1/4 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. coriander
* 1/4 tsp. pepper
* 1/4 tsp. cardamom
* dash clove
* dash nutmeg
* 1-2 chiles
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 3 c. chicken stock
* 3-4 carrots, chopped
* 2 potatoes, chopped
* 1 green bell pepper, chopped


## Directions

1. Dredge thighs and brown in oil in dutch oven.  Remove chicken and set aside.
2. Brown onions in same pan, then add spices. Saute briefly.
3. Add stock and chicken, and simmer 45 minutes.  (I skipped this step.)
4. Add potatoes and carrots and simmer for 30 minutes.
5. Add bell pepper and cook for 10 more minutes.

Serve with crusty bread.

## Variants

The green pepper is technically a variant, and the whole thing is a variant of some other recipe involving quince.

I also added a dash of red lentils early on.
