# Instant Pot Turkey Tenders

The internet generally recommends you steam seasoned turkey tenders on the trivet in an Instant Pot.  I found that dried them out, but see the variants for the details.

This recipe was adapted from an oven recipe for marinated turkey tenderloins [from the kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/turkey-tenderloin-recipe-23218324) (of course the marination step has been removed, along with the oven step), plus [a keto turkey tenderloin instant pot recipe](https://lowcarbyum.com/pressure-cooker-turkey-breast-instant-pot/) that recommended against the trivet.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 lb turkey tenders (about 3 pieces)
* 1 T packed brown sugar
* 1 T smoked paprika
* 2 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. dried ground sage
* 2 tsp. dried thyme
* 2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 1 c. broth or water

## Directions

1. Mix spices.
2. Pat tenders dry and rub with spices.
3. Let them sit if you have time.
4. On saute, brown tenders on both sides.
5. Remove tenders and deglaze pot with the broth.
6. Add tenders to pot (in broth).  Close vent and lid.  Select Poultry, for 7 minutes.
7. Vent steam immediately.

## Variants

The internet says to cook the tenders on the trivet over a cup of water or broth, on high pressure for 20 minutes with a quick release, or from frozen for 30 minutes.  Optionally you can saute them first; reduce the cooking time by 5 minutes.  You don't need to tenderize them first, but it never hurts.  The trivet (or a steamer basket) doesn't fit more than two or three in a 6 quart pot, and even without it four are a very tight fit.
