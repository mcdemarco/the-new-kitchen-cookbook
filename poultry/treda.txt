# Treda

I cut this down from Cooking at the Kasbah because my package of chicken quarters was only 1 1/2 lbs., instead of the recommended 2 1/2 lbs. of thighs. I also substituted various other forms of coriander for the fresh sprigs.

The translated title is "Tagine of Chicken and Lentils with Fenugreek."

## Ingredients

* 1 T olive oil
* 1 onion, sliced
* 1 medium or 3 small campari tomatoes
* 1 1/2 lbs. chicken quarters, separated
* 1 tsp. pepper
* 1 tsp. turmeric
* 1 tsp. salt
* 2 c. water
* 2 cubes frozen cilantro
* dash dried coriander
* dash ground coriander
* 2 T fenugreek seeds
* 1/4 C brown lentils
* 1/8 C red lentils
* a few slices of crusty bread

## Directions

Brown onions in oil.  Add tomatoes, first three spices, and chicken. Cook 5 minutes.  Add water and remaining spices.  Cover and cook on medium 40 minutes.  Add lentils and cook up to 30 more minutes, depending on your patience and the age of your lentils.  Serve over crusty bread.

## Variants

I served this with macaroni (in addition to the bread) the first time, and Peter liked it that way.

I substituted chicken broth for the water, 2 tsp powdered fenugreek for the whole fenugreek, 1tsp dried coriander and 1 tsp ground coriander for the frozen coriander, and 1 lb boneless thighs for the 1 1/2 lbs chicken quarters.
