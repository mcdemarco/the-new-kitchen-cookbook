# Devilled Chicken Thighs

This is an amalgam of an unexpected number of devilled chicken recipes available online, such as [the Food Network's](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/deviled-chicken-thighs-recipe-2119632).  I had no idea it was a thing.  This one in particular is targetted at boneless thighs and is dairy-free, but plenty do bone-in and butter the thighs.

## Ingredients

* 1--1 1/2 lb. boneless skinless chicken thighs
* 1 clove garlic, minced or crushed, or 1/4 tsp. garlic powder
* 1 T. olive oil
* 1/2 c. prepared mustard
* 1/2 T. worchestershire sauce (optional)
* Tabasco sauce to taste (optional)
* lemon juice (optional, if it needs watering down)

* 1/4 tsp. cayenne
* 2/3 c. panko
* 1 tsp. dried parsley
* 1 tsp. paprika
* salt and pepper to taste




## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â°.
2. Mix spices with panko.
3. Mix wet ingredients (wetness may vary according to your choices of ingredients).
4. Rub the chicken pieces with the wet mix.
4. Roll chicken in dry mix or sprinkle on top.
5. Bake for 20--35 minutes, depending on the thickness of the pieces.
