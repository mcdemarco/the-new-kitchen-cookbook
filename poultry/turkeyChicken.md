# Turkey Chicken

"Turkey Chicken" a.k.a. "Fake Turkey" is a turkey drumstick recipe that I make with chicken drumsticks instead. The original recipe was "Pot-Roasted Turkey Drumsticks" from _The Italian Jewish Kitchen_ by Edda Servi Machlin. Other alterations to the recipe involve drastic shortening of the marinating period, significantly less oil, and boiling during the simmering step. I usually cut the recipe in half.  Once, I served it with spaghetti squash.

## Ingredients

* 1 T salt
* 1 tsp dried rosemary
* 1 tsp dried sage
* 1 tsp dried marjoram
* dash nutmeg
* 1-3 cloves garlic, minced or crushed
* 1/3 c. olive oil
* 1/2 c. white cooking wine
* 3 1/2 - 4 lbs chicken legs

## Directions

Roll in a mixture of the salt, spices and garlic. I do this in a big tupperware container, then pour on about a third of a cup of olive oil. Marinate until you're hungry or out of time, then brown them.

Cook at medium heat, stirring frequently, for 20 more minutes. Add wine. Reduce until you're really hungry, then serve.

## Variants

Substitute 1 T fresh spice for any of the 1 tsp dried spices.
