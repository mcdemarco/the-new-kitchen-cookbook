# Turkey Chili

This recipe is based on my beef and bean chili, with some expansions inspired by [the bean guy](https://www.dadcooksdinner.com/instant-pot-quick-turkey-chili-with-canned-beans/).  I like it because it doesn't require the usual soup veggies that I usually don't have around, like carrots, celery, and/or green bell peppers.

I served it over yellow rice the first time.  Other sides include short pasta or flatbread.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. ground turkey
* 1 large onion, chopped (1 c.)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2-4 ancho chilies, stemmed
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* 1 tsp. garlic powder
* 1 tsp. basil
* 1 tsp. oregano
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. ground coriander (optional)
* 1 tsp. brown sugar (optional)
* 1/2 tsp. pure chili powder (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. cinnamon (optional)
* chocolate bits to taste (optional)
* 1/3 c. chicken stock (or add water as needed) -- 2/3 c. for Instant Pot
* 1 15 ounce can tomato sauce or diced tomatoes
* 1/2 can (3 oz) tomato paste 
* 1 15-16 ounce can cannellini beans, rinsed and drained

## Directions

Originally I made this on the stovetop, but I've since switched to Instant Potting it.

### Stovetop 

1. Brown onions and garlic in a large pan in the usual way.
2. Add and brown turkey.
3. Add spices and cook for 1 minute, until fragrant.
4. Add tomato sauce, liquid, and beans.
5. Simmer about 15 minutes.

### Instant Pot

1. Optionally, cook some dried cannellini in the Instant Pot following [my recipe](../vegetables/ipCannellini.md).
2. Saute onions and garlic in the Instant Pot the usual way.
3. Add and brown turkey (about 3 minutes).
4. Add spices and saute for one more minute.
5. Deglaze with the broth.  Don't forget to double the broth quantity, especially if your instant pot is prone to burn warnings.
6. Add all remaining ingredients and mix well.
7. Close pot.  Close vent.  Pressure cook on high for 10 minutes.
8. Release pressure naturally.

## Variants

I've seen instant pot recipes that recommended adding the beans after pressure cooking and sauteing them to temperature.

The bean guy's recipe (linked above) is nicely veggie-free, but much heavier on the beans.
