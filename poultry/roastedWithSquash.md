# Roasted Chicken Quarters with Butternut Squash

This is the first recipe I entered directly into Penflip.  It's a combination of various baked chicken/squash recipies Google spit out, along with a Moroccan chicken and squash stew.  It was inspired by a two pound package of diced butternut squash from Costco.

## Ingredients

* 3 chicken back quarters
* 1 lb diced butternut squash
* 8 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* 1/2 c. walnuts (optional)
* olive oil
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp coriander (or 1 T. fresh cilantro)
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp turmeric
* 1/4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp ginger
* 1/4 tsp ground clove
* 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Directions

1. Mix spices.  Rub chicken with oil and some of the spice.  Lay out in a baking dish skin side up.  
2. Coat squash with oil and remaining spice, and mix in walnuts.  Scatter squash-walnut mixture among chicken.
3. Optionally, cover and refrigerate until dinnertime.
4. Bake at 450 degrees for 45 minutes or until done.
