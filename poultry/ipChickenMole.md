# Instant Pot Chicken Mole

I saw that [Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/pressure-cooker-chicken-mole/#RecipeCard) had a chicken mole recipe, and looked around for one that sounded more my style.  The closest I came was from [Me and the Moose](https://www.meandthemoose.com/blog/2018/4/27/instant-pot-chicken-mole), with a toddler-approved, toss-it-in-the-pot version, which I souped up with my [mole variant for chili](../meat/chili.md).

Serves 3--4.

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs chicken pieces, preferably dark meat, optionally frozen
* 1/2 yellow onion, diced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* oil for sauteing (optional)
* 1 c. chicken stock
* 1 c. canned tomato, undrained
* 2 dried anchos
* 1--2 dried guajillo chili peppers (optional)
* 1--2 dried pasilla chili peppers (optional)
* 1 T. chipotle in adobo (optional)
* dried arbol chilis to taste (optional, spicy)
* 2 T. raisins (optional)
* 2 T. almond butter
* 1 1/2 T. cocoa powder
* 1 T. chili powder
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. ground clove
* 1/4 tsp. allspice
* dash nutmeg
* dash oregano
* dash thyme
* dash pepper
* 1/2 tsp. salt

## Directions

1. Start defrosting the chicken (just a bit) if it's frozen.
2. Optionally toast the dried peppers, in a pan or the Instant Pot on sauté.  Remove and chop.
3. Optionally, brown the onions in the oil on sauté.
4. Optionally, add the chicken and brown to taste.
5. Cancel sauté and deglaze the pot with the liquid ingredients (just pushing the chicken aside as needed).
6. Add and/or return all ingredients to the Instant Pot.
7. Pressure cook on high for 15 minutes or more, depending on how frozen your chicken is at this point.
8. Release pressure and remove the chicken.
9. Sauté the sauce to desired thickness.  This can take a while, so you may want to do it on the stove and make rice or another side in the Instant Pot.
10. Serve sauce over the chicken and side.

## Variants

Ideally you should blend the sauce after cooking it, but I lack an appropriate tool for that step so I've omitted it.
