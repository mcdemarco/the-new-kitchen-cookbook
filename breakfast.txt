### Blueberry Yogurt Pancakes

This is the recipe we came up with after not finding anything particularly helpful online about substituting yogurt for buttermilk. (The Internet did tell me that yogurt juice is actually whey; I kept it for the tartness, but it's also good for you.) We started from the Buttermilk Pancakes recipe in _The Joy of Cooking_, and used Stonyfield Farms whole milk French Vanilla yogurt, and a few too many frozen blueberries, defrosted.

#### Ingredients

* 1 c. flour
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 3/4 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1 egg
* 1 c. yogurt milk
* 1 1/2 tsp. oil
* 1/2 c. blueberries

#### Directions

To make yogurt milk: pour any whey off the top of the yogurt into a 2-cup glass measuring cup. Add yogurt until you reach about 1/2 c. (If you're using whole fat yogurt, avoid any separated fat.) Stir. Add rice milk (or other milk) to get up to 1 cup at buttermilk consistency. Mix dry ingredients. Butter and heat griddle. Beat egg. Add egg and oil to yogurt milk. Mix wet mixture into dry slightly. Mix in blueberries until just mixed. Scoop batter into pancakes of about 3 1/2" diameter and cook on both sides. Bubbling may not happen. Try to keep the griddle from overheating between batches.
