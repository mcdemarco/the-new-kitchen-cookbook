### Non-dairy Cornbread

I got this recipe from [The Joy of Kosher site](http://www.joyofkosher.com/recipes/non-dairy-cornbread/).  I'm guessing I substituted oil for the margarine when I made it, but I may have used Crisco.  I never have margarine around.

#### Ingredients

* 1 cup cornmeal
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 Tbsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/4--1/3 cup sugar
* 1 Egg
* 1 cup soymilk
* 1/4 cup margarine

#### Directions

Preheat oven to 425°.  Mix dry ingredients.  Add in remaining ingredients.  Don't overmix.  Pour into a greased 8 inch square pan.  Bake 20-25 minutes.

## Muffins

### Bran Muffins for Mom

This is a slight alteration of "Raisin Bran Muffins That Work," Recipezaar recipe #73061, that my mother likes. I made it non-dairy. I've only made the blueberry version once or twice.  I also made a diced pear version once.

#### Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 1 c. soy milk
* 1/2 c. canola oil
* 1/4 c. molasses
* 3/4 c. brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 c. wheat bran
* 1 1/2 c. flour
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1 c. raisins (or blueberries, diced pear, etc.)

#### Directions

Preheat oven to 400° F. Beat wet ingredients and sugar. Add bran and let sit 5 minutes. Dust raisins with rye or white flour. Mix other dry ingredients in separate bowl. Add flour mixture to bran mixture and stir gently. Add raisins. Fill 12 muffin cups. Bake 20 minutes.

## Pancakes

### Blueberry Yogurt Pancakes

This is the recipe we came up with after not finding anything particularly helpful online about substituting yogurt for buttermilk. (The Internet did tell me that yogurt juice is actually whey; I kept it for the tartness, but it's also good for you.) We started from the Buttermilk Pancakes recipe in _The Joy of Cooking_, and used Stonyfield Farms whole milk French Vanilla yogurt, and a few too many frozen blueberries, defrosted.

#### Ingredients

* 1 c. flour
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 3/4 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1 egg
* 1 c. yogurt milk
* 1 1/2 tsp. oil
* 1/2 c. blueberries

#### Directions

To make yogurt milk: pour any whey off the top of the yogurt into a 2-cup glass measuring cup. Add yogurt until you reach about 1/2 c. (If you're using whole fat yogurt, avoid any separated fat.) Stir. Add rice milk (or other milk) to get up to 1 cup at buttermilk consistency. Mix dry ingredients. Butter and heat griddle. Beat egg. Add egg and oil to yogurt milk. Mix wet mixture into dry slightly. Mix in blueberries until just mixed. Scoop batter into pancakes of about 3 1/2" diameter and cook on both sides. Bubbling may not happen. Try to keep the griddle from overheating between batches.
