# Anginetti

Anginetti are Italian lemon drop cookies; this is Recipe #104852 from Recipezaar.  It uses lemon extract, which I like because I don't tend to have lemons around unless Peter has bought them for toddy.

## Ingredients

### Cookies

* 1/2 c. sugar
* 1/4 c. vegetable shortening
* 3 large eggs
* 1 1/2 tsp lemon extract
* 2 c. all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/8 tsp salt

### Frosting

* 3 c. confectioners' sugar
* 1/4 c. water
* 1 tsp lemon extract

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350Â°.

Cream sugar and shortening. Add eggs and lemon extract and beat well.  Mix in flour, baking powder and salt.

Scoop onto a greased cookie sheet, 2 inches apart.  Bake 12-15 minutes.  Cool on wire racks.

To frost, mix frosting ingredients until smooth.  Frost tops with a metal spatula.  Allow frosting to dry before stacking.

Store airtight.
