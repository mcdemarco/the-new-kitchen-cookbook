# Raisin-Walnut Challahtaschen

I'm not the biggest fan of hamantaschen, nor have I found the perfect recipe.  (You can read about my travails at my [red bean hamantaschen](../cookies/redBeanHamantaschen.md) recipe.)  But I am a fan of bread, so I decided to try [this yeast dough hamantascchen recipe from Jamie Geller](https://jamiegeller.com/recipes/yeast-dough-hamantaschen/), cut down to experimental size, with a side of [this filling from Sally Bernstein](https://sallybernstein.com/food/recipes/jewish/poppy-seed-hamantaschen.htm).  It's definitely an *I-don't-actually-like-hamantaschen* base for more traditional fillings.  Cheese would be an ideal filling, but that's getting perilously close to a cheese danish instead of a hamantaschen.

As for the name, challah-taschen was apparently all the rage a few years back; they could also be savory and stuffed rather than sweet and filled.

Makes 36 cookies.

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 4 c. flour
* 2 1/4 tsp. yeast
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 c. lukewarm water
* 1 egg
* 6 tablespoons butter, margarine, or shortening
* 1/3 c. sugar
* zest of 1/4 orange
* dash cardamom (optional)

### Topping

* 1 egg, beaten
* powdered sugar (optional)

### Filling

* 1 c. raisins
* 1/3 c. orange juice
* 1/4 c. brown sugar
* 1/2 T. cinnamon
* dash salt
* 1/2 c. walnuts, chopped and toasted
* 1/2 T. lemon or lime juice

## Directions

### Dough

1. Mix ingredients according to your preferred breadmaking method, optionally using a stand mixer and dough hook.
2. Knead into a soft dough.
3. Cover and let rise 1 1/2 hours.  (This is a good time to make your filling.)
4. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper.
5. Roll out to 1/4" thick.
6. Cut into 3" circles or hexagons.
7. Fill with a teaspoon of filling each.  Be careful not to overfill with something that will boil over, like jam.
8. Pinch or fold into the triangular shape.
9. Place on cookie sheets, spacing them an inch apart.
9. Brush with egg.
10. Let rise 30 minutes.
11. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
12. Bake 20 minutes until golden.
13. Optionally sprinkle with powdered sugar.

### Filling

1. If the raisins are hard, soak them in the juice.
2. Prep the walnuts.
3. Dice the raisins.
4. Mix all ingredients but the walnuts and lemon/lime juice in a small pan.
5. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.
6. Lower heat and simmer about 8 minutes until thick.
7. Add lemon or lime juice and cook 3 more minutes.
8. Remove from heat and pan to a cold bowl.
9. Mix in walnuts.
10. Refrigerate until ready to use.

## Variants

The original filling recipe was written for a food processor.  I also totally forgot the lime juice step and omitted a lot of cooling.

Jam is the usual last-minute filling, but nutella is a good, if dairy and crumbly, option.
