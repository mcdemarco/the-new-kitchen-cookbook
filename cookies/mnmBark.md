# M&M Brownie Bark

This is a mix of I Heart Eating's [M&M Brownie Bark Recipe](https://www.ihearteating.com/mm-brownie-bark-recipe/) and her source recipe from King Arthur Flour, [Brownie Crisps](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/brownie-crisps-recipe), which used chocolate chips exclusively.

I don't normally cook with M&Ms, but a guest insisted on leaving us an unopened bag of two or three pounds of them, and we had a party to go to.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 c. flour
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. baking soda
* 2 egg whites

* 3 T dutch processed cocoa powder
* 2/3 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/3 tsp. coffee extract (optional)

* 1 c. M&Ms

## Directions

1. Mix flour, salt and baking soda.
2. Separately, mix sugars and cocoa.
3. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
2. Separately, whisk egg whites until foamy.
3. Whisk remaining liquid ingredients into the egg.
4. Whisk sugar mix into the egg mixture.
5. Whisk flour mix into the egg mixture.
6. Line a cookie sheet or jelly roll pan with parchment paper.
7. Spread dough evenly on the parchment paper with a spatula.

8. Bake 20 minutes.
9. Remove, slice, and return to the oven for 5 more minutes.
10. Cool in pan.

## Variants

One of the original recipes was a bit incoherent on the flour amount.  Reducing the flour may result in thinner crisps, or maybe it was just a typo.

One of the original recipes called for espresso powder and milk powder.

I have seen similar recipes that included nuts.
