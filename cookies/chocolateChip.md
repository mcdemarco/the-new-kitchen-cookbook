# Chocolate Chip Cookies

I tend to make the Classic Crunchy Chocolate Chip cookies from the King Arthur Cookie book; they also have a [recipe online](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe) which is not either recipe from the book.  I replace the butter with more shortening.  Sometimes I cut down the recipe from the full 4 1/2 dozen to 3 dozen, thus:

## Ingredients

* 2/3 c. shortening
* 2/3 c. brown sugar
* 1/3 c. white sugar
* 1 1/3 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. cider vinegar
* 2/3 of an egg
* 2/3 tsp. baking soda
* 1 1/3 c. flour
* 2 c. chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Cream together all but the last four ingredients. 
2. Add egg.
3. Add baking soda with flour. 
4. Add chocolate chips.
5. Spoon 1 T. per cookie onto a greased baking sheet.
6. Bake at 350Â° for 12-14 minutes. 
7. Cool on a rack.

## Variants

Substitute nuts for up to half of the chips.
