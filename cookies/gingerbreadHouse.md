# Gingerbread House

There's a wide range of gingerbread recipes for house-building purposes, from primarily decorative to downright delicious, and the recipe is neither the first nor the last of the long list of decisions you must make when the free prefab gingerbread house work promised you and you promised your toddler falls through:

* Inedible or theoretically food or yummy?
* Prefab or prebaked or from scratch?
* [Cookie cutters from China](https://www.michaels.com/product/gingerbread-house-cookie-cutter-set-by-celebrate-it-10724090) or [paper templates](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Sallys-Baking-Recipes-Gingerbread-House-Template.pdf) or [3D printed cookie cutters](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5964496)?
* McMansion or middling (~5") or [miniature](https://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Stainless-Chocolate-Biscuit-Decorating/dp/B0779FF1R1?tag=mcdema-20)?
* Boxy or A-frame or over-complicated?
* Butter or Crisco or margarine? 
* [Royal icing](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/royal-icing/) or [melted sugar](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C0rNjZbOVbz/) or a hot glue gun (blech)? 
* [Melted sugar or candy](https://www.allmomdoes.com/blog/3-ways-to-make-gingerbread-house-windows-no-candy-thermometer-required/) or expensive [clear isomalt](https://sugargeekshow.com/recipe/isomalt-recipe/) windows?

I wanted something on the more edible side, with molasses, shortening, and less than a whole bag of flour, so I started with [the best gingerbread recipe ever](https://tikkido.com/blog/BEST-gingerbread-house-recipe-free-printable-templates), then simplified and spiced it up a bit.  The original recipe is [here](https://tikkido.com/sites/default/files/PDF-gingerbread-house-recipe.pdf); weights, though in ounces, are also available, as is an entire e-book about gingerbread.

Another bonus for the toddler was that this dough doesn't require chilling, and the baked pieces doesn't require a day of rest to harden.

Makes 2 small houses.

## Ingredients

### Cream

* 2 c. white sugar
* 1 c. brown sugar
* 1 c. butter-flavored Crisco
* 3 eggs
* 1/4 c. molasses

### Dry

* 2 tsp. baking soda
* 1 T. ground ginger
* 1 T. cinnamon
* 1/2 T. allspice (optional)
* 1 tsp. ground clove
* 1/2 T. salt
* 5--6 c. flour

### Other

* crushed hard candy or prepared isomalt for windows
* 1 c. hot white sugar for assembly and/or windows, or royal icing for assembly
* royal icing and/or [crusting buttercream](https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/gingerbread-house/#tasty-recipes-66571) for decoration
* candy and other edible decorations

## Directions

### House

1. Preheat oven to 375Â° (with convection).
2. In a stand mixer with paddle attachment or by hand, cream granulated sugars and Crisco.
3. Cream in eggs, then molasses.
4. Mix other dry ingredients with a cup of the flour, and cream in. 
5. Mix in four more cups of flour.
6. If the dough is still sticky, add up to another cup of flour.
7. Roll out onto parchment paper on a cookie sheet (flat or inverted) to 1/8" thickness.  (Note that this is thinner than most gingerbread house recipes.)
8. Cut shapes out in place, with about 1/2" spacing.  (Remove the spacing and optionally reroll to make any smaller parts.)  Don't forget to punch out any door and window holes at this point, and bake them separately.
9. Bake 10--13 minutes.
10. Let cool on the sheet(s) on a rack.
11. If making windows, remove windowless pieces from the cookie sheet and fill windows with crushed candy, prepared isomalt, or the melted sugar (see directions).  If not liquid, bake again until it liquifies.  Cool again and carefully remove from parchment paper.
12. Assemble the house on a sturdy base using royal icing or melted sugar.

It's handy to have a base(ment) piece of gingerbread for the house, but any kind of base will do, including cake rounds, tin foil over cardboard, or parchment paper on a half-sized baking sheet.  When assembling with icing, you may need temporary supports such as empty cans.

### Melted Sugar

When melting sugar, use only heatproof (*i.e.*, non-plastic) utensils.  Don't transfer to cold glass or pyrex.  Keep children away and, if possible, wear gloves.

1. Heat a cup of sugar in a clean, wide pan on the stovetop on medium, stirring frequently, until it turns amber.  
2. Pour carefully into windows, or dip gingerbread edges into the pan for assembly.

Alternatively, you can microwave sugar and karo syrup at a 2:1 ratio in a Pyrex measuring cup.  Cook on high about 5 minutes until it turns amber.

## Variants

If you don't want to use parchment paper, you can grease the cookie sheet.  I haven't heard of people using silpats but I don't see why not.  If making windows, you should switch to parchment paper or aluminum foil at that point.

It's common to chill the dough quite a long time, and I suppose it couldn't hurt if it's feeling too soft.  Another trick is to freeze the pieces before baking to reduce spread.  It's somewhat less common to give the pieces a day to stale up a bit, but if that fits your schedule it should be fine.

It's easy to make your own royal icing with meringue powder or powdered egg whites.  The internet recommends this over kit icings or storebought, especially for assembly.

A fine toddler tradition is to skip the gingerbread altogether and use graham crackers instead.  I might have tried this if I hadn't already done it for Sukkot:  ![graham cracker sukkah](../images/sukkot1.png)   ![graham cracker sukkot](../images/sukkot3.png)
