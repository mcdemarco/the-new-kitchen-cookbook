# Nan Berenji

![Nan berenji](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/Nan_berenji.jpg)

This is my classic rice flour cookie recipe that I've been making for years. It's from _Sephardic Cooking_ by Copeland Marks (p. 186).  I also experimented with a Nan Berenji recipe in the _New Food of Life_ cookbook, but that one failed.

## Ingredients

* 1 stick butter or margarine
* 2/3 c. sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 T. water
* 2 c. rice flour
* 1/4 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. ground cardamom
* 2 tsp. poppy seeds.

## Directions

Cream butter and sugar. Mix in eggs and water. Add dry ingredients (except poppy seed). Roll 1 heaping tsp. at a time and press down onto greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with poppy seed. Bake 20 minutes at 350Â°.
