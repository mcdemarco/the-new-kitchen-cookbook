# Authentic Biscotti

As I mentioned, I burned out my first pizzelle iron.  On the day that it gasped its last gasp, I had already made the cookie dough, so I had to find something else to do with it.  I got out my Italian cookbook and discovered that biscotti had almost the same ingredients, so I adjusted the flour and learned to make biscotti.

I still have that cookbook, but the recipes I use now are from Recipezaar.  "Authentic" biscotti is half of Recipe #300513, by Summerlea; it uses anise seed and almonds.

## Ingredients

* 3	 eggs
* 1/2	 c. pure olive oil
* 1	 c. sugar
* 2	 T. anise seed
* 3 1/4	 c. all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2	 tsp baking powder
* 1/2	 tsp salt
* 3/4	 c. almonds, chopped or sliced

## Directions

Preheat oven to 350°.  Grind the anise seed with a mortar and pestle.  Beat eggs, then add the oil, sugar and anise.

Mix in the remaining ingredients.  Lightly flour and roll the dough into one or two logs 2 inches in diameter.

Place on a greased baking sheet or parchment paper.  Bake 25 minutes.
Remove from the oven, slice diagonally into 1/2 inch thick slices.  Bake 10 minutes on sliced side, then flip and bake until slightly browned.  

To harden further, dry in the oven at 250°.
