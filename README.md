the-new-kitchen-cookbook
========================

My Markdown cookbook, imported from penflip because I tended to edit locally and push with Git 
(an unexpectedly buggy use case, especially when it came to images) rather than take advantage of 
Penflip's editor or download features.

For more details, start with [About *The New Kitchen Cookbook*](about.md), 
or use [the index on my website](http://mcdemarco.net/recipes/).
