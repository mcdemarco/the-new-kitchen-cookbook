The New Kitchen Cookbook
========================

This is my Markdown cookbook, which I imported from
[Penflip](https://www.penflip.com/mcdemarco/the-new-kitchen-cookbook/) because I tended to edit locally
and push with Git (an unexpectedly buggy use case, especially when it came to images)
rather than take advantage of Penflip's editor or download features.

For more details about the cookbook *qua* cookbook, start with [About *The New Kitchen Cookbook*](preface/about.md), 
or use [the index on my website](http://mcdemarco.net/recipes/).

For more details about the tranformation of these markdown files to a cookbook-like website, 
see the README in the `_contents` directory and my [blog posts](//mcdemarco.net/blog/tags/recipes/) about it.
