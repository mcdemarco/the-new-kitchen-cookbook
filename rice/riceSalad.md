# Rice Salad

This is one of my favorite recipes, but I don't make it very often because of the variety of cans of stuff required.  I adapted it from one of my favorite cookbooks, *The Book of Jewish Food* by Claudia Roden, mainly by upping my favorite ingredients and making others optional.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. long-grain rice
* 6 T. olive oil
* 4 T. white wine vinegar
* 16 black olives
* 3 T. capers
* a small or medium jar of quartered marinated artichoke hearts
* 1 or 2 2 oz. cans of anchovies, chopped
* 1 or 2 small cans of tuna, preferably preserved in oil, flaked (optional)
* 16 cherry or grape tomatoes, halved if large
* salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

Make the rice as usual but in extra water, then drain.  Dress with liquids and spices while hot.  Mix in remaining ingredients.  Serve hot or cold.
