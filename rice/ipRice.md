# Instant Pot Rice

The bible of rice is at [Green Healthy Cooking](https://greenhealthycooking.com/instant-pot-rice/).  In general, instant pot rice is 1:1, rinsing optional, manual high pressure, with a natural release.  Rice is basmati or jasmine unless mentioned otherwise.

## Ingredients

1. Add all ingredients to pot and stir.
2. Close instant pot, and seal the vent.  
3. Set to manual high pressure.
4. Pressure cook on high for 3 minutes (white), 22 minutes (brown), or 30 minutes (wild).
5. Turn off keep warm.
6. Turn off keep warm.

You can cook wild rice 28 minutes if you prefer it less "burst."

Peter prefers the brown basmati cooked longer, but a final cooking time has not yet been determined.

I have not explored instant pot Brazilian-style rice yet.
