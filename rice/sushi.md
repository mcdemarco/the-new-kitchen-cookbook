# Sushi Rice

I used to have a non-mirin sushi rice recipe here, but since my mirin has been restocked I'm switching back to my mirin version, which may have originally come from Eden Foods.

## Ingredients

* 2 c. sushi rice, unrinsed
* 3 1/4 c. water
* 1 T. maple syrup
* pinch sea salt
* 2 T. brown rice vinegar
* 1 T. mirin

## Directions

1. Combine first four ingredients in a small heavy pan with a lid.
2. Bring to a boil.
3. Simmer 20 minutes.
4. Let rest 10 minutes.
5. Transfer to a glass bowl, preferably spreading the rice with a bamboo paddle.
6. Sprinkle the last two ingredients into the bowl and toss gently.
7. Chill or let cool at room temperature before serving.

## Variants

Sweetening sake is the most auspicious substitute for mirin, though my previous recipe used white cooking wine.

For some spicy mayo to go with your sushi, combine 1 T. mayo and 1 tsp. Sriracha.  (Peter found this recipe online, probably [here](http://www.justonecookbook.com/how_to/spicy-mayo-recipe/).)
