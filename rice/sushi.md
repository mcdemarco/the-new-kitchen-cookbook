# Sushi Rice

I used to make sushi rice with rice vinegar and mirin, but the price of real mirin has gone up so I don't just have it sitting around to toss on my avocado udon anymore. Sweetening sake is the most auspicious substitute, but my sake was still in storage so I made the following recipe up out of some recipes I found online. 

For real sushi rice with mirin, I recently consulted [this recipe](http://low-cholesterol.food.com/recipe/minados-perfect-sushi-rice-119373).  The changes, cut down to my size, are included below in parentheses.  (I omitted the kelp leaf and made the draining optional.)

### Ingredients

* 1 c. sushi rice
* 1 1/3 c. (or 1 c.) water
* 2 T. rice vinegar
* 1 1/2 T. sugar
* 1 tsp. sea salt
* 1 T. white cooking wine (or mirin)

### Directions

1. Optionally, rinse the rice three times.
2. Optionally, drain the rice for 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the season.
3. Bring the rice in the water to a boil.
4. Simmer, covered, 15--20 minutes.
5. Mix the other ingredients.
4. Optionally, heat the other ingredients in a small pan. (optional; you can just mix them) until they're mixed well.
5. Optionally, let the rice sit after cooking, covered, for 10 additional minutes. 
6. Mix everything together in a glass bowl.
7. Chill or let cool at room temperature before serving.

### Condiments

For some spicy mayo to go with your sushi, combine 1 T. mayo and 1 tsp. Sriracha.  (Peter found this recipe online, probably [here](http://www.justonecookbook.com/how_to/spicy-mayo-recipe/).)
