# Sushi Rice

I used to have a non-mirin sushi rice recipe here, but when my mirin was restocked I switched back to the mirin version, which may have originally come from Eden Foods.  Instant Pot directions were inspired by [Amy & Jacky](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-sushi-rice/), and are easier to cut in half than the stovetop version.

Makes 6 cups cooked rice.

## Ingredients

* 2 c. sushi rice, unrinsed
* 3 1/4 c. water (2 c. in the Instant Pot)
* 1 T. maple syrup
* pinch sea salt
* 1/4 tsp. dashi powder (optional)
* 2 T. brown rice vinegar
* 1 T. mirin

## Directions

### Stovetop

1. Combine first five ingredients in a small heavy pan with a lid.
2. Bring to a boil.
3. Simmer 20 minutes.
4. Let rest 10 minutes.

(Instructions continued below.)

### Instant Pot

1. Rinse rice gently, using the steaming basket if you have one or a mesh strainer.
2. Combine first five ingredients in the Instant Pot.
3. Seal and pressure cook on high for 0 (zero) minutes.
4. Wait 20 minutes (natural release).

### Both

5. Transfer to a glass bowl, preferably spreading the rice with a bamboo paddle.
6. Sprinkle the remaining ingredients into the bowl and toss gently.
7. Chill or let cool at room temperature before serving.

## Variants

Sweetening sake is the most auspicious substitute for mirin, though my previous recipe used white cooking wine.

For some spicy mayo to go with your sushi, combine 1 T. mayo and 1 tsp. Sriracha.  (Peter found this recipe online, probably [here](http://www.justonecookbook.com/how_to/spicy-mayo-recipe/).)
