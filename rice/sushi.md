# Sushi Rice

I used to make sushi rice with rice vinegar and mirin, but the price of real mirin has gone up so I don't just have it sitting around to toss on my avocado udon anymore. Sweetening sake is the most auspicious substitute, but my sake was still in storage so I made the following recipe up out of some recipes I found online. 

### Ingredients

* 1 c. sushi rice
* 1 1/3 c. water
* 2 T. rice vinegar
* 1 1/2 T. sugar
* 1 tsp. sea salt
* 1 T. white cooking wine

### Directions

Optionally, rinse the rice. (I forgot.) Bring the rice in the water to a boil.  Simmer 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining ingredients in a small pan until they're mixed well. Mix it all together when done. Chill. 

## Variants

For real sushi rice with mirin, I recently consulted [this recipe](http://low-cholesterol.food.com/recipe/minados-perfect-sushi-rice-119373).  Cut down to my size, the changes are: reduce the water to 1 c. and replace the cooking wine with mirin.  Let cool instead of chilling.  (Omit the kelp leaf and the draining.)
