# Stuffed Peppers

This one is also adapted from *The Book of Jewish Food* by Claudia Roden.

## Ingredients

* 6 bell peppers

* 1 large onion, diced
* 6 T. olive oil, divided
* 1 1/4 c. Arborio rice
* 2 c. water
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. pepper
* 1/4 tsp. allspice (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. cinnamon (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. ground clove (optional)

* 3 T. pine nuts
* 1/4 c. raisins or currants
* 1 large tomato, chopped, or 1 T. tomato paste
* 2 tsp. mint
* 3 T. fresh dill or parsley, chopped
* 2-3 T. lemon juice

## Directions

Fry the onion in half the oil.  Add the rice and fry to transparency as in risotto.  Add water, sugar, and dried spices (except mint). Cook covered for 15 minutes. (Rice will be underdone.)  Meanwhile, cut the caps off the bell peppers (keeping them) and clean out the peppers.  Set peppers aside.

Take the rice off the heat and mix in the remaining ingredients.  Fill the peppers with the stuffing, replace the caps, and arrange them upright in a baking dish.  Put a scant inch of water in the bottom of the dish and bake at 375Â° for 45-55 minutes.
