# Instant Pot Farro and Lentils

This is an [Instant Pot] experiment based on [Smitten Kitchen's French Onion Baked Lentils and Farro](https://smittenkitchen.com/2024/01/french-onion-baked-lentils-and-farro/) and its predecessor [inaccessible NYT recipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1020809-baked-farro-with-lentils-tomato-and-feta) for Baked Farro With Lentils, Tomato and Feta.

You can make it plain as a side, or add cheese for more of a meal.

Serves two as a main meal with cheese, or 3--4 as a side dish.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 T. olive oil
* 2 yellow onions, diced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 c. farro
* 1/2 c. green or brown lentils
* 3 c. chicken or vegetable stock
* 1 T. dry wine (optional)
* several sprigs of fresh thyme
* salt to taste
* pepper to taste
* red pepper flakes to taste (optional)
* 5 oz. soft cheese (*e.g.*, gruyere or feta, optional)

## Directions

1. Sauté onions to desired level of brownness.
2. Add garlic and sauté one more minute.
3. Optionally, sauté the farro.
4. Deglaze the pot with wine or some broth.  Add stock.
5. Cancel sauté, close instant pot, and seal the vent.
6. Pressure cook on high for 10 minutes.
7. Release pressure naturally.
8  If it's still soupy, turn on sauté to cook the liquid down.
9. Remove thyme sprigs.
10. Optionally, move to a serving platter or baking dish and top with cheese.
11. Optionally broil cheese topping.

## Variants

You can stir in cheese at the end or when serving.  You can broil it on top if you're feeling fancy enough to transfer to an oven-proof dish.

Replace some of the liquid with canned tomato.

Add oregano, rosemary, and/or basil with the thyme.
