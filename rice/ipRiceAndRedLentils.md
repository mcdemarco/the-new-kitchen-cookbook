# Instant Pot Rice and Red Lentils

This is a not-kitcheree side dish I thought ought to be obvious, but the internet was surprisingly unforthcoming about it.  I based this recipe on a stovetop recipe for [curried rice and red lentils](https://kalynskitchen.com/curried-rice-and-red-lentils-best/), and some eyeballing.  More experimentation may be needed.

## Ingredients

* 1 small yellow onion, chopped
* 1 T. olive oil
* 2/3 c. rice
* 1/3 c. red lentils
* 1 tsp. Jamaican curry powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt, or to taste
* dash pepper
* 1 1/2 c. hot water or broth

## Directions

1. Saut√© the onions in the oil.
2. Add rice, lentils, and spices and stir for a minute.
3. Add liquid.  Deglaze if necessary.
4. Close instant pot and seal the vent.  
5. Set to manual high pressure.
6. Pressure cook on high for 4 minutes.
7. Turn off keep warm.
8. Release steam at will.

## Variants

I chose the curry powder at random.  A different one, or a whole different spice mix, would also work.

For more flavor, brown the onions well, then add only the curry for another 2 minutes.  (I wasn't sure this would really work in an instant pot, so I didn't try it.)

Kitchree is similar, but you cook it to death (say, 20 minutes), and the spices vary.
