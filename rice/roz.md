# Roz bil Shaghria

This is an Arab recipe from Claudia Roden; it's just rice dressed up with some toasted vermicelli.  American vermicelli is about halfway between spaghetti and capellini (angel hair); Italian vermicelli is thicker than spaghetti.  I have no idea what size shaghria (a.k.a. she'reya) is, but it's a forgiving recipe so just use whatever you have around.  Onion is a common additions, but I don't use it here.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 c. vermicelli
* 2 T. sunflower or canola oil
* 1 1/4 c. basmati or other long-grain rice 
* 3 c. water
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. saffron or turmeric (technically optional)

## Directions

Break up the vermicelli to desired size.  (It's supposed to be an inch but I prefer them longer.)  Toast them in a dry frying pan or in the oven, stirring frequently.  Set aside.

Fry the rice in the oil as for risotto.  Add the toasted vermicelli and remaining ingredients, cover, and simmer 20 minutes.  Remove from heat and let rest five minutes.  Serve hot.
