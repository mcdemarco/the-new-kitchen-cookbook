# Saffron Risotto

This is a basic no-cheese risotto from Claudia Roden, which I cut down by a third.

## Ingredients

* 1 c. Arborio rice
* 2 T. olive oil
* 2 2/3 c. chicken stock
* 1/3 c. white wine
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/3 tsp. saffron (powder or threads)
* extras: mushrooms fried in some garlic

## Directions

Start the stock boiling in a small pot on another burner.  

In your good risotto pan, fry the rice in the oil until (somewhat) transparent.  Rather than the eternal night of the risotto (see the next recipe), you can cheat and add all the liquid at once.  Simmer for 20-25 minutes, adding the saffron (and optional mushrooms) late but while there's still liquid to dissolve it.
