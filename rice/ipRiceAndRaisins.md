# Instant Pot Rice and Raisins

This is a not-kitcheree side dish I thought ought to be obvious, but the internet was surprisingly unforthcoming about it.  I based this recipe on a stovetop recipe for [curried rice and red lentils](https://kalynskitchen.com/curried-rice-and-red-lentils-best/), and some eyeballing.  More experimentation may be needed.

* 1 1/2 tsp. curry powder
* 1 tsp. smoked paprika
* 1 tsp. thyme
