# Orzo

Orzo is Italian for barley, though it sounds like rice and is made of pasta.  Orzo is sometimes called risoni (big rice).  I moved it here to the rice chapter after the restructuring of the pasta chapter because it cooks like rice.

## Ingredients

* 4 tbsp. olive oil
* 1/2 lb. orzo
* 2 cups chicken broth
* handful of pine nuts (optional)

## Directions

1. Heat broth in a small pot.
2. Toast pine nuts in dry sauce pan.  Remove.
3. Add oil to the pan and toast orzo in it.
4. Add broth gradually, as with risotto.
