# Wild Rice Stuffing

A rice-based turkey stuffing based on [The Spruce Eats'](https://www.thespruceeats.com/wild-rice-stuffing-4767437).

## Ingredients

### Rice

* 1/2 c. long grain white rice
* 1/2 c. brown rice
* 1/2 c. wild rice
* 1 1/2 c. chicken broth, or more
* 3/4 tsp. salt, divided

### Extras 

* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 2 stalks celery, diced
* 1/2 lb. mushrooms, sliced
* 1/3 c. chopped chestnuts or other nuts
* 1/3 c. raisins
* 1/3 c. other diced dried fruit
* 1/4 c. dry wine or wine vinegar (optional)
* 2 T. orange juice (optional)
* 1 T. dried parsley
* 1 tsp. sage
* 1/2 tsp. tarragon
* 1/2 tsp. marjoram
* 1/2 tsp. thyme
* 1/2 tsp ground bay leaf
* pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Cook rice separately in broth and salt as desired, *e.g.,* in the [instant pot](../rice/ipRice.md).  
2. Saute onions and celery.  Add mushrooms.
3. Add remaining ingredients including rice and heat through.
4. Let cool.
5. Stuff bird.
6. Serve any extra stuffing at any temperature.

## Variants

Cook the wild rice and brown rice together to save time.

Add some squash chunks, leeks, sausage, or giblets.

I substituted some ingredients I had around for the more common dried cranberries, and removed garlic for a guest.
