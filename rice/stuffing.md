# Wild Rice Stuffing

A rice-based turkey stuffing inspired by [Epicurious'](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/wild-rice-dressing) and [The Spruce Eats'](https://www.thespruceeats.com/wild-rice-stuffing-4767437).

Stuffs: 1 turkey

## Ingredients

### Rice

* 1/2 c. long grain white rice (uncooked)
* 1/2 c. brown rice (uncooked)
* 1/2 c. wild rice (uncooked)
* 1 1/2 c. chicken broth, or more
* 3/4 tsp. salt, divided

### Extras 

* olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 2 stalks celery, diced
* 1/2 lb. mushrooms, sliced
* 1/3 c. chopped chestnuts or other nuts
* 1/3 c. raisins or dried cranberries
* 1/3 c. other diced dried fruit
* 2 T. tarragon wine vinegar (optional)
* 2 T. orange juice (optional)
* 1 T. dried parsley
* 1 tsp. sage
* 1/2 tsp. tarragon
* 1/2 tsp. marjoram
* 1/2 tsp. thyme
* 1/2 tsp ground bay leaf
* pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Cook rice separately in broth and salt as desired, *e.g.,* in the [instant pot](../rice/ipRice.md).  
2. Saute onions and celery.  Add mushrooms.
3. Add remaining ingredients including rice.  Heat through if you're not stuffing a bird.
4. Stuff bird.  If your turkey is small, there will be leftovers so be careful not to cross-contaminate them with raw poultry.
5. Serve remaining stuffing at any temperature.

## Variants

Cook the wild rice and brown rice together to save time (*e.g.,*  for 28 minutes in an Instant Pot).  If you really want to instant pot the whole thing, replace the white rice with more brown and/or wild rice, saute the onion and celery in the instant pot, add the raw rice, 1 1/2 c. broth, and other non-liquid non-fragile, ingredients.  Then cook for 28 minutes, release naturally, and stir in any remaining ingredients.

You can substitute a wild rice mix for the assorted rices; cook it according to package directions.

Add some squash chunks, leeks, sausage, or giblets.

I substituted some ingredients I had around for the more common dried cranberries and nuts, and tarragon wine vinegar for sherry or red wine vinegar.
I also removed the perennial garlic for a guest.
