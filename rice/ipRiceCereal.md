# Instant Pot Brown Rice Cereal

There are no "multi-cooker" instructions for Bob's Brown Rice cereal on their website, though they do specify the procedure below for their multigrain cereals that include brown rice and also require 8 minutes of stovetop cooking.  I have cut it down to a reasonable quantity; for four official servings see [Bob's website](https://www.bobsredmill.com/recipes/how-to-make/basic-preparation-instructions-for-10-grain-cereal).

Makes 1 large serving.

## Ingredients

* 1/3 c. Bob's brown rice cereal
* 1 c. water
* dash salt

## Directions

1. Add all ingredients to pot and stir.
2. Close Instant Pot and seal the vent.
3. Set to manual high pressure.
4. Pressure cook on high for 2 minutes.
5. Turn off keep warm.
6. Release steam naturally (after 10 minutes).
7. Stir well to unstick from the bottom, and serve.

## Variants

For a smaller serving size, try 1/4 c. rice in 3/4 c. water.  This is less than the usual quantity of water you would want in the Instant Pot, but will probably work.

For larger quantities, the proportion is one part cereal to three parts water.
