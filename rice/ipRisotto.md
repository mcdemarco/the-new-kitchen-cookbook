# Instant Pot Risotto

This is a basic no-cheese risotto for the instant pot, based on an extremely basic one in [How To Instant Pot](https://amzn.to/3cwlXm2).

Serves two as a main meal with extras (one person per half cup of rice), or 3--4 (per cup) as a side dish.  I scale the full meal up to at least 1 1/4 c. rice when we're hungry.

## Ingredients

* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 yellow onion, diced (optional)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced (optional)
* 1 c. Arborio rice or more
* 2 c. chicken, vegetable, or meat stock (or twice the amount of rice, if using more rice)
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* other spices to taste (*e.g.*, pepper, turmeric, sage, etc.)
* optional extras (mushrooms, vegetables, etc.)

## Directions

1. Optionally (in the instant pot), saute the onions in the oil on low to desired transparency.  Add garlic and saute one more minute.
2. If the extras cannot stand up to pressure cooking, saute them now until cooked, then fish them out and set aside.
3. Saute the rice in the oil.
4. Add stock and any durable extras.  Stir.
5. Cancel saute, close instant pot, and seal the vent.
6. Pressure cook on high for 7 minutes.
7. Release steam artificially.
8. Open pot and stir in any fished-out extras.

If your extra is mushrooms, subtract the volume of mushroom juice from the broth when adding broth.

## Variants

You can stir in cheese at the end or when serving.
