# About Risotto

Risotto is more a style than a recipe; I have a favorite risotto style that I made up myself.  If you don't know what you're doing, though, I suggest starting with a basic mushroom & cheese risotto recipe (not included), instead of the no-cheese options below.  Do not substitute anything American for the rice unless you know it works; use Italian arborio rice.  You don't have to use fresh stock; I have used cubes as well as some nice organic powdered stocks.  [Better Than Boullion](http://www.betterthanbouillon.com/locator.aspx) is also good (but sadly no longer kosher).

You also need a good pan: either enameled cast iron or a heavy-bottomed stainless steel pan works best.  If you don't have one, you had better know what you're doing.  My risotto pan is a somewhat wok-shaped enameled pan from Mario Batali that works well (but that I don't think they make anymore)---you can see it in some of the pasta pictures.

For more risotto advice, see [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/how-to-make-risotto-without-recipe-article) or my [Tempeh Risotto](../rice/tempehRisotto.md) recipe.

Here's an index of my risottos:

* [Tempeh Risotto](../rice/tempehRisotto.md) covers a multitude of variations.
* [Saffron Risotto](../rice/saffronRisotto.md) is more traditional.
* [Carcass Risotto](../rice/carcassRisotto.md) is less traditional.
* [Instant Pot Risotto](../rice/ipRisotto.md) is even less traditional, but my favorite approach by far.
