# About Risotto

Risotto is more a style than a recipe; I have a favorite risotto style that I made up myself.  If you don't know what you're doing, though, I suggest starting with a basic mushroom & cheese risotto recipe (not included), instead of the no-cheese options below.  Do not substitute anything American for the rice unless you know it works; use Italian arborio rice.

You also need a good pan: either enameled cast iron or a heavy-bottomed stainless steel pan works best.  If you don't have one, you had better know what you're doing.  My risotto pan is a somewhat wok-shaped enameled pan from Mario Batali that works well (but that I don't think they make anymore)--you can see it in some of the pasta pictures.

You don't have to use fresh stock; I have used cubes as well as some nice organic powdered stocks.  [Better Than Boullion](http://www.betterthanbouillon.com/locator.aspx) is also good.
