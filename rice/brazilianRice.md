# Brazilian Rice

I used to think Brazilian white rice was just rice, even though it was always mysteriously yummier than homemade rice.  Then I found [a recipe for it](https://braziliankitchenabroad.com/brazilian-white-rice/) online.  This is not that recipe, because it was lacking in quantities, but rather an amalgamation of other such recipes online.

TL;DR: you just start with onions and garlic as you would for other foods like pasta sauce or sauteed vegetables.

## Ingredients

* 1 T. olive oil or to taste
* 1 small yellow onion, diced
* 1--4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 c. basmati or jasmine rice
* 1 1/2 c. water
* 1 tsp. salt
* other spices to taste

## Directions

1. In a 2 quart pan, fry the onions in the oil for at least 4 minutes.
2. Add garlic and cook up to another minute.
3. Toast rice in the oil briefly as with risotto.
4. Add hot water and salt.
5. Bring to a boil.
6. Cover and simmer 15 minutes until water is absorbed.
7. Let sit 10 more minutes.

## Variants

The original recipe didn't appear to include onions, only garlic.  This appears to be a common variant, for brown rice as well.

Speaking of which, you can also do this with brown basmati, if you increase the cooking time appropriately.

You can cook the rice according to your own preference; the Brazilian approach is refreshingly lacking in rinsing, boiling over, and other rice superstitions.
