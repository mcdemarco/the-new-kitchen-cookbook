# Crepes

I used to make a lot of crepes, back when I kept milk in the house and had a couple of good pans for them.

## Ingredients

* 1 c. unbleached flour
* 1 T. sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 c. milk
* 1/3 c. water
* 3 eggs
* 3 T. butter, melted

## Directions

1. Mix dry ingredients.
2. Blend in wet ingredients.
3. Heat ungreased non-stick 7 inch skillet.
4. Pour in batter 3 T. at a time.
5. Tilt pan.
6. Cook until light brown (30-45 seconds) then flip and cook 15 seconds more.

Cooked crepes may be refrigerated up to 2 days.
