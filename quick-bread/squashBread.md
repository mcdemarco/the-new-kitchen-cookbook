# Butternut Squash Bread

For freshness, I've cut this down to one loaf from a [typical one-can-of-pumpkin recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/easy-pumpkin-bread-recipe).  A typical butternut squash is also about a pound after cooking.

Makes one 9" x 5" loaf.

## Ingredients

### Wet

* 1/2 lb. cooked and pureed butternut squash
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 c. oil
* 1/3 c. water
* 1 1/3 c. brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract

### Dry

* 1 2/3 c. flour
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp [pumpkin spice](../appetizers/pumpkinSpice.md)

### Extras

* 1/2 c. chopped walnuts
* 3/4 c. raisins or currants
* sanding sugar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
2. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.
3. Puree squash if necessary (say, with an immersion blender).
4. Optionally toast nuts 6--8 minutes in oven.
5. Beat liquid ingredients and sugar, optionally in a stand mixer.
6. In another bowl, mix together dry ingredients.
7. Add dry mixture to wet and mix.
8. Stir in nuts and raisins.
9. Fill loaf pan.
10. Sprinkle with sanding sugar.  
11. Bake about 70 minutes until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
11. Cool on a wire rack.

## Variants

The original recipe suggested waiting overnight before serving.

Nutmeg will do in place of the spice mix.

Raisins and nuts are optional.  Chocolate chips are another option.

It can be glazed.

Makes 4 3" x 5" loaves; bake them about 50 minutes.
