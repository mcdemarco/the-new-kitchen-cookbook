# Scones

I made [Smitten Kitchen's cinnamon sugar scones](https://smittenkitchen.com/2019/09/cinnamon-sugar-scones/), but with a stand mixer and other minor adjustments.  They were quick, and still tasted like scones despite the appearance of something...fluffier.

Makes 6 scones

## Ingredients

### Dry

* 1 3/4 c. (230 g.) flour
* 1 T. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 stick butter, diced

### Wet

* 1 egg
* 1/4 c. half and half

### Topping

* 2 tsp. cinnamon, separated
* 2 1/2 T. sugar, separated

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°.
2. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
3. Using a the pastry beater attachment, mix the dry ingredients to a cornmeal consistency.
4. Switch to a dough hook (or normal beater) to mix in the wet ingredients until just moistened.  Do not overmix.
5. Roll out into a 10" long rectangle on a cold countertop.  
6. Sprinkle 1 T. of sugar and 1 tsp. of cinammon over the middle half of the rectangle, leaving a quarter of the rectangle on each side.  Fold the quarters over the middle.
7. Roll out again to an 8" long rectangle.
8. Sprinkle 1 T. of sugar and 1 tsp. of cinammon over the middle half of the rectangle again and fold again.
9. Shape the resulting square into a circle.
10. Cut the circle in half along the last fold line, then into thirds to form six triangular scones.
11. Transfer the scones to the cookie sheet, spacing them out.
12. Bake 15 minutes or until golden-browning at the edges.
13. Serve fresh.


## Variants

You can do it all with a pastry cutter and a spoon; the KitchenAid is a bit of overkill.  You can also use a food processor.

Skip the cinnamon sugar and try other fillings or spices.
