# Non-dairy Cornbread

I got this recipe from [The Joy of Kosher site](http://www.joyofkosher.com/recipes/non-dairy-cornbread/).  I'm guessing I substituted oil for the margarine when I made it, but I may have used Crisco.  I never have margarine around.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup cornmeal
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 Tbsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/4--1/3 cup sugar
* 1 Egg
* 1 cup soymilk
* 1/4 cup margarine

## Directions

Preheat oven to 425Â°.  Mix dry ingredients.  Add in remaining ingredients.  Don't overmix.  Pour into a greased 8 inch square pan.  Bake 20-25 minutes.
