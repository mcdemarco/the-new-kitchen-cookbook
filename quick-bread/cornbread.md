# Non-dairy Cornbread

I based this recipe on one from [The Joy of Kosher site](http://www.joyofkosher.com/recipes/non-dairy-cornbread/), with dairy variants from a recipe on the back of Indian Head cornmeal.

## Ingredients

* 1 c. cornmeal
* 1 c. whole wheat flour (or white flour)
* 1 T. baking powder
* 1/2--1 tsp. salt
* 1/4--1/3 c. sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 c. soymilk (or milk)
* 1/4 c. oil 

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425° (400° with convection).
2. Grease an 8" square pan or a 12-muffin muffin pan. 
2. Mix dry ingredients.
3. Mix wet ingredients.
3. Mix wet ingredients into dry.  Don't overmix.
4. Pour into pan, or fill muffin cups 2/3 full per muffin.
5. Bake pan for 20--25 minutes, or muffins for 12--15 minutes.

## Variants

The original recipe called for margarine.  I have never owned a stick of margarine, so I'm guessing I substituted oil for the margarine, but Crisco or coconut oil might also work and I may have tried Crisco at some point.

For a dairy cornbread or corn muffins, I use the white flour, the lower sugar value, the higher salt value, and lactose-free milk.

The original recipe was pan only; I added the muffin variant, probably from the same source as the dairy variant.
