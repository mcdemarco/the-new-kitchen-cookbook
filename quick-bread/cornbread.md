# Non-dairy Cornbread

I based this recipe on one from [The Joy of Kosher site](http://www.joyofkosher.com/recipes/non-dairy-cornbread/) and a similar one from [The Taste of Kosher](https://www.thetasteofkosher.com/dairy-free-cornbread/#mv-creation-91-jtr) with dairy variants from a recipe on the back of Indian Head cornmeal.

## Ingredients

### Dry

* 1 c. cornmeal
* 1 c. whole wheat flour or all-purpose flour
* 1 T. baking powder
* 1/2--1 tsp. salt

### Wet

* 1/4--1/3 c. sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 c. soymilk or water
* 1/4--1/3 c. oil or applesauce

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425° (400° with convection).
2. Grease an 8" square pan or a 12-muffin muffin pan. 
2. Mix dry ingredients.
3. Mix wet ingredients.
3. Mix wet ingredients into dry.  Don't overmix.
4. Pour into pan, or fill muffin cups 2/3 full per muffin.
5. Bake pan for 20 minutes, or muffins for 12--15 minutes.

## Variants

The original recipe called for margarine.  I have never owned a stick of margarine, so I'm guessing I substituted oil for the margarine, but Crisco or coconut oil might also work.  I may have tried Crisco at some point.  Applesauce is another popular replacement for butter or oil.

For a dairy cornbread or corn muffins, I use white flour, the lower sugar value, the lower oil value, the higher salt value, and lactose-free milk.  [Smitten Kitchen recommends](https://smittenkitchen.com/2015/02/perfect-corn-muffins/) cooking the cornmeal in milk until it thickens, then cooling it down with the other liquids before adding egg.  (I'd pour it into a chilled bowl as well.)  You could also try soaking (in milk or water) if you have the time.

With water, use the higher oil value.

The original recipes were pan only; I added the muffin variant, probably from the same source as the dairy variant.
