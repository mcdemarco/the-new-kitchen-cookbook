# Peach Quick Bread

We have friends who like to pick peaches, so I had some leftovers during peach season and decided to try a [peach cake](../sweets/peachCake.md) from A Farmgirl's Dabbles.  She also had a [peach bread](https://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/peach-bread/) which looked close enough to my [applesauce banana bread](../quick-bread/applesauceBananaBread.md) to convert.  This is that conversion.

Makes one 9" x 5" loaf.

## Ingredients

### Wet

* 1 1/2 c. peeled and chopped ripe peach
* 2 eggs
* 1/3 c. oil
* 1 c. brown sugar
* 2 tsp. vanilla extract

### Dry

* 2 c. flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 T [pumpkin spice](../appetizers/pumpkinSpice.md)

### Extras

* 2/3 c. chopped walnuts (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 325Â° (with convection).
2. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan and dust with flour.
3. Optionally toast nuts 6--8 minutes in oven.
4. Mix wet ingredients (except peaches, but including any excess juice), optionally in a stand mixer.
5. In another bowl, mix together dry ingredients.
7. Add dry mixture to wet and mix.  Do not overmix.
8. Stir in nuts and peaches.  Optionally, reserve some of either or both for topping.
9. Fill loaf pan.
10. Bake about 60 minutes until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.  If the top starts getting too dark, cover with foil.
11. Cool in the pan on a wire rack.

## Variants

The original recipe called for 1/2" chunks of peach, but I go smaller for more consistency.

You can use cinnamon and/or nutmeg in place of the spice mix.

The original recipe has an alternative version using yogurt.
