# Savory Zucchini Muffins

This recipe is derived from [Lucini's Savory Zucchini Bread](http://www.lucini.com/recipes/category/side-dishes/savory-zucchini-bread), a 9x5 loaf recipe, but I've only made it as muffins.  I also added currants, non-white flour, and some extra spices, but never the Parmesan.

When I'm making savory muffins I don't usually use muffin cups; I have a non-stick muffin tin.  I generally serve them as a vegetable.

Maxes a baker's dozen, or 30--36 mini-muffins.

## Ingredients

* 2 medium zucchini, shredded (about 1 1/2 c. or 12 oz.)
* 1 c. chopped walnuts
* 3 eggs
* 1/3 c. extra virgin olive oil, plus 1 tsp for oiling the muffin pan
* 1/3 c. soy milk with vinegar or buttermilk
* 1/2 c. currants
* 1 1/2 c. total mixed white, whole wheat, and rye flour 
* 1/3 c. dark brown sugar
* 1/2 T. (1 1/2 tsp) baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 c. grated Parmesan cheese (optional)


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
2. Grease muffin tin.
3. Shred zucchini (say, with a box grater).
3. Toast nuts 6-8 minutes in oven.  Let cool.
4. Whisk together eggs, oil and milk.
5. Mix in zucchini and currants.
6. In another, large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, soda, salt, and spices.  
7. Add wet mixture to dry, stirring to just dampen.
8. Add chopped nuts and optional Parmesan.
9. Scoop into muffin tin.
10. Bake in middle of oven 25--35 minutes for regular muffins, or 10--20 minutes for mini-muffins, or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.
11. Cool 10 minutes in pan, then remove and cool on wire rack.

The original recipe suggested refrigerating them overnight.

## Variants

Substitute raisins for currants in an emergency.

My most recent batch used the combination of 3/4 c. white flour, 1/2 c. whole wheat, and 1/4 c. rye.
