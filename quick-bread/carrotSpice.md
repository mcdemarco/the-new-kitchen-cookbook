# Carrot Spice Muffins

This is another Recipezaar recipe, [#98447](https://www.food.com/recipe/cha-ching-carrot-spice-muffins-98447?scale=12), cut down and otherwise adapted for my purposes.

Sometimes I serve them as a vegetable.

Makes 12 muffins.

* 3/4 c. whole wheat flour
* 1/4 c. white flour
* 2/3 tsp baking soda

* 1/8 tsp ground ginger
* 1/8 tsp allspice
* 3 1/2 T. honey or brown sugar
* 2/3 egg
* 1/3 c. buttermilk, yogurt, or soy milk with lemon juice
* 3 1/2 T. oil, melted butter, or applesauce

* 1/3 c. raisins
* 1/3 c. chopped nuts or coconut

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°.
2. Mix flour, leavening, and spices.
3. Separately, mix remaining ingredients.
4. Stir the mixtures together until just moistened.
5. Bake about 15 minutes, or to the toothpick test.

## Variants

The original was entirely whole wheat flour, and made 18 muffins (thus the thirds of so many ingredients).
