# Ricotta Pancakes

This Italian pancake is the ancestor of the latke, according to Tori Avery.  I cut the recipe down for serving alongside modern latkes; for more pancakes see [the original recipe](http://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/2010/12/cheese-latkes/).

Makes 10--12 pancakes.

## Ingredients

* 2/3 c. whole milk ricotta
* 1/2 c. flour
* 2 eggs
* 4 tsp. white sugar
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
* scant 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* butter, oil or cooking oil spray, for frying

## Directions

1. Mix all measured ingredients.
2. Fluff with an immersion blender or a food processor.
3. Fry in a non-stick pan.

To prepare (partly) ahead of time, measure and mix the liquid ingredients and dry ingredients separately.  Combine and fluff before frying.
