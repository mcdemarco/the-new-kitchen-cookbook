# Ricotta Pancakes

This Italian pancake (*cassola*) is the ancestor of the latke, according to [Tori Avery](http://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/2010/12/cheese-latkes/).  I cut the recipe down for serving alongside modern latkes, but then scaled it back up again because it wasn't enough for breakfast.

I made these again recently with store brand ricotta, and they were much thicker than usual; I had to milk them down quite a bit.  YMMV.


## Ingredients

### Cut-Down Recipe

Makes 10--12 mini pancakes.

* 2/3 c. whole milk ricotta
* 1/2 c. flour
* 2 eggs
* 4 tsp. white sugar
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
* scant 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* butter for frying

* 1 c. whole milk ricotta
* 3/4 c. flour
* 3 eggs
* 2 T. white sugar
* 1 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* butter for frying

## Directions

1. Mix all measured ingredients.
2. Fluff with an immersion blender or a food processor.
3. Fry in butter (or other appropriate oil) in a non-stick pan.

## Variants

To prepare (partly) ahead of time, measure and mix the liquid ingredients and dry ingredients separately, and refrigerate the liquid ingredients.  Combine and fluff before frying.
