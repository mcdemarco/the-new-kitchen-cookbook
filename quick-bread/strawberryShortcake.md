# Strawberry Shortcake

This is another Mother's Day request, based on plenty of similar recipes.  Some recipes use two different creams for the dough and topping, but [The New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/11823-strawberry-shortcake) was thoughtful enough to just use whipping cream for the heavy cream, while [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/summer-recipe-oldfashioned-str-150927) did it all with heavy cream.  (This recipe is cut down from those, so see them for better scaling up.)

For non-dairy biscuits, see my [coconut oil](../quick-bread/coconutOilBiscuits.md) or [Guinness](../quick-bread/guinnessBiscuits.md) biscuit recipes.

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

### Shortcake

* 2 c. white flour
* 1 T. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 1/2 T. sugar
* 3/4 stick butter (6 T.)
* 1/2 T. vanilla extract
* 3/4 c. cream
* 1 T. sanding sugar (optional topping)

### Strawberries

* 1 pint strawberries, cut to a desirable size
* 1/4 c. sugar 

### Whipped Cream

* 1 c. cream
* 1 1/2 T. confectioners sugar (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. cream of tartar (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract (optional)

## Directions

1. Mix the dry, non-topping shortcake ingredients.
1. Preheat the oven to 425Â°.
2. Cut in the butter with a pastry cutter (not all the way to pea size).
3. Stir or cut in the cream and vanilla.
4. Press the dough together like pie dough.
5. Roll out the dough to 1 inch thickness.
6. Cut out with a cookie cutter.
7. Put on greased or lined cookie sheet and brush with butter or cream.
8. Optionally sprinkle with sanding sugar.
9. Bake 15 minutes.
10. While baking, prep strawberries.
11. Whip cream.  Add sugar and tartar mix slowly, while beating to desired perkiness.  Optionally then beat in extract.

You may want to cool the biscuits completely before splitting.

## Variants

You can make dough with a food processor if you insist.

You can make individual biscuits (rolling out to half an inch) or splittable biscuits (rolling out to an inch).  

Some recipes scoop the dough by 1/3 cups rather than rolling it out, *e.g.,*  [The Pioneer Woman](https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a39026449/strawberry-shortcake-recipe/) and [The Spruce Eats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/our-best-strawberry-shortcake-recipe-7482908).  

I spotted one recipe that used milk instead of cream for the shortcake.
