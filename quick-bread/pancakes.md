# Non-dairy Pancakes

This is another Recipezaar recipe (#35161) that I used to make, but that has mostly been supplanted by the dairy pancake recipe.  I cut it down to two-person size and switched from margarine to oil.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 c. cornmeal
* 1/2 c. soymilk or rice milk
* 1 egg
* 2 T. oil
* 1/3 tsp. salt
* 2 T. sugar
* 1/4 c. whole wheat flour
* 1/2 c. white flour
* 2 tsp baking powder

## Directions

Soften the cornmeal in some of the liquid.  Preheat the griddle.

Beat together the eggs, remaining liquid, oil, and salt.
Mix in the cornmeal mixture and dry ingredients.  If not pourable, adjust as needed by adding liquid.

Grease the griddle.  Use 1/4 c. batter per pancake.  Cook until bubbly with an edge, then flip.
