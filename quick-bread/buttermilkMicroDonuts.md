# Buttermilk Micro Donuts

My new micro donut maker (also known as a Dash Express Mini Donut Maker) came with an assortment of recipes, but none of them involved leftover buttermilk.  The internet came through for me at [Simply Good Cooking](https://simplygoodcooking.com/easy-dash-mini-donut-maker-recipes/).  This is my remix of a couple of "their" saner recipes.  (I avoided the ones that involved slicing or filling micro donuts, that can only have been written by an AI who has neither seen nor used a micro donut maker.)

Makes 12--14 micro donuts.

## Ingredients

### Wet

* 1 c. buttermilk
* 1 egg
* 2 T. melted butter
* 1/4. c. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract

### Dry

* 1 c. flour
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 1/4 tsp salt

### Glaze

* 1/8 c. maple syrup
* 1/4 c. confectioner's sugar

### Toppings

* sprinkles (optional)
* sanding sugar (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat micro donut maker according to manufacturer's directions.
2. Mix wet ingredients, optionally in a stand mixer.
3. In another bowl, mix together dry ingredients.
4. Add dry mixture to wet and mix until smooth.
5. Butter micro donut maker with a silicone pastry brush.
6. Fill wells 3/4 full with batter.  (Yes, it's unclear what this means.)  As for *how* to do it, I recommend using a pastry bag or a cupcake injector, but you can use a scoop the dough for less cleanup, and/or if you want the holes to have a thin layer of donut in them.
7. Bake 2 minutes.
9. Flip using an appropriate utensil for non-stick surfaces, or a toothpick.
10. Bake 2 more minutes.
11. Cool on a wire rack over a pan.
12. Mix glaze.
13. Dip donuts in glaze and return to rack.
14. Optionally sprinkle with toppings.

## Variants

The glaze could stand some thickening.

The original recipe says you can eat them unglazed, but they're more like a muffin than a donut that way.  The non-donutness of the micro donuts needs some concealing.

Cinnamon sugar is another intriguing topping from the AI site, but I'd just use my own [recipe for it](../appetizers/cinnamonSugar.md) rather than hazard the slop.

You can make mini (not micro) donuts [in the oven](https://wearenotmartha.com/mini-donuts/), if you have a mini donut pan.
