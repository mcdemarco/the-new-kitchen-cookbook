# Cream Biscuits

It took me a long time to make basic biscuits; mostly I've attempted [non-dairy](../quick-bread/coconutOilBiscuits.md) [biscuits](../quick-bread/guinnessBiscuits.md), ["easy" biscuits](../quick-bread/easySourCreamBiscuits.md), and other [biscuit-adjacent](../quick-bread/strawberryShortcake.md) [things](../quick-bread/scones.md).  This one still isn't a basic milk-and-butter recipe; instead it uses heavy cream, which I had left over after I made a biscuit-adjacent recipe.  It was inspired by [The Spruce Eats' cream biscuits](https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-cream-biscuits-3051623), but a cup and a half of cream seemed like an odd amount to have left over so I cut it down to one cup.

Makes about 6 biscuits.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/3 c. flour
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1 heaping tsp. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 c. heavy cream
* 1 T. melted butter (for brushing)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â° with convection.
2. Prepare a baking sheet with spray or parchment paper.
3. Mix dry ingredients well.
4. Mix in cream without overmixing.
5. Knead gently, then roll out to 3/4" thick.
6. Flour the top well if it's still sticky, and cut out with a biscuit cutter or a large cookie cutter.
7. Place on the prepared baking sheet.  Don't worry if they're crowded.
8. Bake for 12--14 minutes or until golden on top. 
9. Remove from oven and brush tops with melted butter.

Serve warm.

## Variants

You can substitute whipping cream.  To substitute sour cream, see my [easy sour cream biscuits](../quick-bread/easySourCreamBiscuits.md) recipe.  To make *this* recipe "easy", try a self-rising cream biscuit recipe like [The Seasoned Mom's](https://www.theseasonedmom.com/cream-biscuits/).

For non-dairy biscuits see my [coconut oil](../coconutOilBiscuits.md) or [Guinness](../quick-bread/guinnessBiscuits.md) biscuits.

For sweet biscuits, up the sugar to 2 tablespoons and add pie spices.

For savory biscuits, add herbs, spices, and/or up to a cup of shredded or grated cheese.

You can bunch cold biscuits together in a greased pan to encourage them to rise higher.
