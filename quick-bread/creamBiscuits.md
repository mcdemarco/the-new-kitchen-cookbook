# Cream Biscuits

It took me a long time to make basic biscuits; mostly I've attempted [non-dairy](../quick-bread/coconutOilBiscuits.md) [biscuits](../quick-bread/guinnessBiscuits.md), ["easy" biscuits](../quick-bread/easySourCreamBiscuits.md), and other [biscuit-adjacent](../quick-bread/strawberryShortcake.md) [things](../quick-bread/scones.md).  This one still isn't a basic milk-and-butter recipe; instead it uses heavy cream (left over after I made a biscuit-adjacent recipe), as recommended by [The Spruce Eats](https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-cream-biscuits-3051623).

Makes 8--10 biscuits.

## Ingredients

* 2 c. flour
* 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 2 tsp. sugar
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 1 1/2 c. heavy cream
* 1--2 T. melted butter (for brushing)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â° with convection.
2. Prepare a baking sheet with spray or parchment paper.
3. Mix dry ingredients well.
4. Mix in cream without overmixing.
5. Knead gently, then roll out to 3/4" thick.
6. Cut out with a biscuit cutter or a large cookie cutter and place on the prepared baking sheet.
7. Bake for 12--14 minutes or until golden on top. 
8. Brush tops with melted butter.

Serve warm.

## Variants

You can substitute whipping cream.  To substitute sour cream, see my [easy sour cream biscuits](../quick-bread/easySourCreamBiscuits.md) recipe.  To make *this* recipe "easy", try a self-rising cream biscuit recipe like [The Seasoned Mom's](https://www.theseasonedmom.com/cream-biscuits/).

For non-dairy biscuits see my [coconut oil](../coconutOilBiscuits.md) or [Guinness](../quick-bread/guinnessBiscuits.md) biscuits.

For sweet biscuits, up the sugar to 3 tablespoons and add pie spices.

For savory biscuits, add herbs, spices, and/or up to a cup of shredded or grated cheese.

You can bunch cold biscuits together in a greased pan to encourage them to rise higher.
