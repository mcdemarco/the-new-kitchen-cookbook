# Dairy Pancakes

This is just your average pancake recipe from [Food.com](http://www.food.com/recipe/pancakes-25690), though I have my own ideas about which ones are the dry ingredients.

## Ingredients

### Dry

* 1 c. flour (or possibly more)
* 1 tsp. baking powder

### Wet

* 1 egg
* 3/4 c. milk
* 2 T. melted butter
* 1 T. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. salt


## Directions

Beat egg until fluffy then mix in other wet ingredients.  Combine dry ingredients separately, then add.

Grease the griddle with butter.  Cook until bubbly with an edge, then flip.
