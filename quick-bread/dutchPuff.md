# Dutch Puff Pancake

Better known as a Dutch baby pancake and completely unknown as a Dutch poof pancake, a Dutch puff is an unleavened pancake that poofs up purely with its own steam in the oven.  I made one on request for Mothers Day, based on [this recipe from The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-a-dutch-baby-pancake-227629) for a 9--10 inch oven-proof pan, which is apparently better in the batter-vs-pan dimension than one my sister tried at 12 inches.

Serves 2--4.

## Ingredients

### Batter

* 1/2 c. white flour
* 1/2 c. whole milk
* 2 eggs
* 2 T. sugar
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp. table salt

### Pan

* 2 T. butter

### Toppings

* powdered sugar
* fruit

## Directions

1. Mix the batter with an immersion blender or blender.
2. Let the batter rest for at least 20 minutes.
3. Preheat the oven to 425Â° with the skillet in it.
4. Transfer skillet to stove or a good trivet.
5. Add butter, and swirl it around to melt it.
6. Add batter.  Swirl it too, if necessary.
7. Return to oven and bake about 20 minutes until poofy and lightly browned on top.
8. Serve hot.

## Variants

Apparently you can add the fruit to the bottom of the pan before adding the batter and it will still poof.  (I have not tried this yet.)

I have seen pictures of poofs made in glass baking dishes or pie plates, so don't despair if you don't have an oven-proof skillet of the appropriate dimensions.
