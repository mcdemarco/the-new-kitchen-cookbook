# Blueberry Corn Muffins

![blueberry corn muffins](../images/blue_muffins.png)

This recipe is based on [Hearty Lemon Blueberry Corn Muffins](http://www.joyofkosher.com/recipes/hearty-lemon-blueberry-corn-muffins/) from the Joy of Kosher.  I made it non-dairy in my own special way rather than following their recommendations, and I also treated the corn meal like I do wheat bran in my bran muffins.

Some muffins are pictured in muffin cups, but muffin cups are counter-indicated.

Makes twelve muffins.  (Some did not last long enough to be photographed.)

## Ingredients

### Wet

* 1 egg
* 1 c. rice milk
* 1/2 T lemon juice
* 1/4 c. canola oil
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 3/4 c. yellow cornmeal

### Dry

* 1/2 c. white flour
* 1/2 c. whole wheat flour
* 1/2 T baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1--1 1/2 c. blueberries (fresh or frozen)


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.  Grease muffin tin.
2. Mix together "wet" ingredients except cornmeal.  Add cornmeal and let sit 5 minutes.
3. Mix together "dry" ingredients except blueberries in separate bowl. Add blueberries and stir to coat.
4. Fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients.  Do not overmix.
5. Scoop into prepared muffin tin.
6. Bake 20--25 minutes.

## Variants

For mini muffins, reduce baking time to 10--15 minutes.

Some more white flour probably wouldn't hurt.  Also, coating the blueberries with wheat flour only might be a better approach, chemically speaking.

It fluffs the muffins a bit to substitute 1/4 c. wheat bran for 1/4 c. of the cornmeal (and soak it with the cornmeal), but Peter thought that made them taste bran-y instead of corny.  I also mixed the blueberries with an extra 2 T white flour rather than as directed above.

The muffins tend to lack structural integrity, especially in muffin cups but also in a non-stick pan.  You could probably get around this by cutting the blueberries down to 1 c., but I haven't tried that yet.
