# Alevropita (Quick Feta Flatbread)

This is a cut-down version of a recipe from [Marilena's kitchen](https://marilenaskitchen.com/feta-cheese-flat-bread/).  I've made the full version in a glass baking dish, but I thought it would crisp up better in a metal pie tin.

Serves 3--4.

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 3/4 c. flour
* 1/2 c. milk
* 1 egg
* 1/4 c. plain yogurt
* 1/4 tsp. salt 
* dash pepper

### Topping

* oregano to taste
* 1/2 c. crumbled feta 
* 1 1/2 T olive oil, plus more for the pan

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â° F.
2. Oil a pie tin and place it in the oven to warm.
3. Mix the dough ingredients, optionally in a stand mixer.   (A paddle is fine for this recipe.) 
4. Prep the toppings if necessary.
5. Take out the pie tin and brush to distribute the oil.
6. Pour in the dough.
7. Top with the toppings.
8. Bake 20--25 minutes or until golden on top, poking any bubbles that develop.

Serve warm.

## Variants

For a muffin-shaped version, see my [Eliopsomo](../bread/eliopsomo.md).

Chop some olives and add them to the dough.
