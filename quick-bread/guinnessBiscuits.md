# Guinness Beer Biscuits

This recipe is derived from [Cooking With Curls](http://cookingwithcurls.com/2013/03/15/beef-stew-with-guinness-biscuits-crazy-award/), a blog I ought to be following.  I wanted something to go with leftover lamb stew that would be quicker than bread and non-dairy.

Makes 6 large or 10--12 small biscuits.

## Ingredients

* 2 c. flour
* 2 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 6 T. butter-flavored Crisco
* 3/4 c. Guinness draught beer

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°.
2. Mix dry ingredients well.
3. Cut in the shortening with a pastry cutter or fork to make coarse crumbs.
4. Mix in beer.
5. Turn onto a floured surface and roll out to 9" x 6" x 1/2".
6. Cut into the desired number of squares or hexagons.
7. Bake on parchment paper for 20 minutes or until golden brown.

## Variants

Replace shortening with butter to make the original, dairy recipe.

The original recipe also allowed replacing the Guinness with a lesser beer.
