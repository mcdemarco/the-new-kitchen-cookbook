# Pumpkin Banana Bread

[Pumpkin](../quick-bread/squashBread.md) and [banana bread](../quick-bread/applesauceBananaBread.md) are two great tastes that aren't really that distinct in my versions.  Nevertheless, sometimes the half-cans and overripe bananas align and I wanted to mix them up, but I didn't want to just mix them together without consulting [an authority](https://www.thekitchn.com/pumpkin-banana-bread-recipe-23214749).

Note that, like its brethren, this is not a *quick* quick bread.

Makes one 9" x 5" loaf.

## Ingredients

### Wet

* 1 stick butter or margarine, at room temperature
* 2 overripe bananas (about 3/4 c.)
* 1/2 can pumpkin puree (about 3/4 c.)
* 1 or 2 eggs
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 1/2 c. brown sugar
* 1 T. vanilla extract

### Dry

* 1 1/2 c. flour
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp baking soda
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 T. [pumpkin spice](../appetizers/pumpkinSpice.md)

### Extras

* 3/4 c. chopped walnuts

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
2. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan and dust with flour.
3. Cream butter and mash bananas (say, with a stand mixer).
4. Optionally toast nuts 6--8 minutes in oven.
5. Beat (or whip) wet ingredients (including sugar), optionally in a stand mixer.
6. In another bowl, mix together dry ingredients.
7. Add dry mixture to wet and mix.  It is customary at this point to say *do not overmix*.
8. Stir in most of the nuts.
9. Fill loaf pan.  Top with remaining nuts.
10. Bake about 60 minutes until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.  If the top starts getting too dark, cover with foil.
11. Cool in the pan on a wire rack for 10 minutes, then out of the pan until cool.

## Variants

The original recipe melted the butter.

Note the ratio of pumpkin to banana is 1:1; feel free to tweak the proportions as long as you come out to about 1 1/2 c. total.

You can use cinnamon and/or nutmeg in place of the spice mix.

You can replace a half cup of the flour with some other flour.

You can leave the nuts out of the inside and use most of them as a topping.
