# Almond Flour Muffins

The almond flour muffins recipe [at Elana's Pantry](https://elanaspantry.com/ratio-rally-quick-breads-almond-flour-muffins/) seems to be the grandmother of every almond flour muffin recipe on the internet, and this one is no exception.  It's included here (cut down to one egg) as a record of my experiments with it.  The base recipe definitely needs more flavor, but science hasn't yielded final flavorings yet.

Though dry measures are given in the ingredient list, my eggs and honey didn't weigh nearly as much as predicted so I recommend weighing the ingredients instead as described in the instructions.  Do not substitute anything else for the almond flour; if you don't know whether something counts as almond flour then it probably doesn't.

The recipe yields slightly more than 2 muffins per egg; commenters at Elana's Pantry reported getting ten muffins from 4 eggs.

## Ingredients (Per Egg)

* 1/2 c. (2 oz.) almond flour
* 1/8 tsp. baking soda
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 T. honey or maple syrup
* 1/4 tsp. apple cider vinegar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350° F (325° with convection).
2. Crack egg(s) and weigh. 
5. In a separate, smaller bowl, weigh out almond flour equal to the weight of the eggs.
3. Divide the weight by 1/4 and add that much honey to the egg bowl.
4. Multiply the vinegar measurement by eggs and add that much vinegar to the egg bowl.  Mix.
6. Multiply the baking soda measurement by the number of eggs and add to the almond flour bowl.
7. Add any optional spices to the almond flour bowl and mix.
7. Add dry mixture to wet mixture and stir gently.
8. Scoop into the appropriate number of paper muffin cups (2 per egg).
9. Bake 15 minutes.
10. Cool 30 minutes in the pan.

## Variants

If you want the full 1/2 cup/2 ounces of almond flour (*e.g.,* for more predictability) you can top off the weight of the eggs with oil or applesauce.

You can spray a non-stick muffin tin with oil instead of using paper muffin cups; make sure to cool it the whole half hour, and use a toothpick to help release any stuck muffins.

Commenters mentioned adding zest, cardamom, cinnamon, salt, vanilla, almond extract, blueberries, raspberries, raisins, craisins, coconut, pecan, candied ginger, apricot, chocolate chips, applesauce, banana, yogurt, olive oil, water, agave, and icing (not all at once).
