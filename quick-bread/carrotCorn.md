# Carrot Corn Mini Muffins

I had lots of leftover carrots and 45 minutes.  Peter thought I couldn't do it, but the only glitch was discovering I was out of whole wheat flour, so [this recipe](http://mmmisformommy.com/2015/01/mini-carrot-muffins.html) became cornier.  I also tossed in some spices from my carrot spice muffin recipe.

Makes 24.
