# Coconut Oil Biscuits

This recipe has been altered slightly from [oh, ladycakes'](http://web.archive.org/web/20180503024333/http://www.ohladycakes.com/how-to-make-coconut-oil-biscuits/) and some simpler recipes for biscuits made with coconut oil.  It's also not unlike my [Guinness biscuit recipe](../quick-bread/guinnessBiscuits.md).  It came with weights and I mostly used them, especially for the gooey coconut oil.

**Caution:** Some people react poorly to coconut oil.

Makes six large or 10--12 small biscuits.

## Ingredients

* 2 1/4 c. (315 g.) flour
* 1 T. tapioca starch (polvilho doce)
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. salt
* 6 T. (65 g.) coconut oil
* 1 c. almond and/or coconut milk

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â°.
2. Mix dry ingredients well.
3. Work in the oil with your fingers to make coarse crumbs.
4. Mix in almond milk without overmixing.
5. Turn onto a floured surface and pat out into a rectangle about 2/3" thick.
6. Dust with flour and fold into thirds like a letter.
7. Pat out, dust, and fold again.
8. Pat out again.
6. Cut into the desired number of squares or hexagons with a knife or cookie cutter.
7. Bake on parchment paper for up to 15 minutes or until golden specks appear.

## Variants

Most such recipes don't include the starch.  Oh, ladycakes lists some less successful [variants](http://www.ohladycakes.com/evolution-of-a-recipe/) of the recipe as well.
