# Savory Almond Flour Muffins

I finally found an almond flour muffins recipe not descended from [Elana's](https://elanaspantry.com/ratio-rally-quick-breads-almond-flour-muffins/); instead [Kirbie's Cravings' recipe](https://kirbiecravings.com/low-carb-keto-biscuits/) is descended from [this one](https://www.isavea2z.com/low-carb-biscuits-recipe-keto-friendly/).  I have altered it somewhat.

The recipe yields about 12 biscuits.

## Ingredients (Per Egg)

* 1 1/2 c. fine almond flour
* 1 T. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp. garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp dried onion
* fresh chives (optional)
* fresh thyme (optional)
* red pepper flakes (optional)
* 2 large eggs
* 1/2 c. full fat Greek yogurt
* 4 T. melted butter
* 1/2 c. shredded cheddar cheese mix

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450° F (425° with convection).
2. Mix dry ingredients.
3. In a separate, larger bowl, mix wet ingredients.
4. Mix mixes and mix in cheese.
5. Scoop into a lightly greased muffin tin.
6. Bake 9--11 minutes.
7. Cool briefly.

## Variants

The original recipe called for sour cream instead of yogurt.

Rosemary is another spice possibility.

When melting the butter include any spices that will benefit from the extra cooking time, such as the dried onion and red pepper flakes.
