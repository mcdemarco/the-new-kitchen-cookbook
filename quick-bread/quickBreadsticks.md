# Quick Breadsticks

This is a strangely neglected recipe from [Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/crunchy-breadsticks/) for "crunchy" breadsticks, which I've only altered slightly.

Makes 16 breadsticks.

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 2 c. flour
* 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 3 T. butter-flavored Crisco
* up to 3/4 c. cold water

### Topping

* olive oil
* 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp. thyme

## Directions

1. Mix dry dough ingredients.
2. Cut in shortening with a pastry cutter or food processor to form a coarse crumb.  It's not a lot of shortening, so it takes longer than with pie crust.
3. Mix water in gradually to form a dough ball.
4. Preheat the oven to 350Â°.
5. Roll dough out to 10" x 8" on parchment paper or a floured pastry board.
6. Cut in half from one 8" side to the other four times to make 16 1/2" wide strips.
7. Brush with olive oil and sprinkle with other toppings.
8. Separate the strips, twist them as much as is practical, and place on cookie sheets (optionally lined with parchment paper).
9. Bake 20 minutes.
10. Cool on a rack.

## Variants

The original recipe called for food-processing the dough.
