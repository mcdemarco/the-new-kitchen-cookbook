# Chocolate Ricotta Mini Muffins

I had some ricotta but no almonds or lemon zest, so with some difficulty I found a muffin recipe that involved ricotta and something besides lemon: [Chocolate Ricotta Muffins](http://stylishcuisine.com/?p=5686).  My main change was in proportion of maxi to mini muffins:  I made 24 mini muffins and 6 maxi ones (the latter because I didn't have time to wait for the tin to cool in between).

Makes about 36 mini-muffins.

## Ingredients

### Dry

* 2 1/3 c. white flour
* 7 T. unsweetened cocoa
* 2 tsp baking powder
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 c. sugar

### Wet

* 1 c. ricotta
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/3 c. milk
* 4 T. melted butter
* 1 T. vanilla

### Extra
 
* 1 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â° (with convection).
2. Spray muffin tins.
2. Mix dry ingredients in a large bowl.
3. Mix wet ingredients in a smaller bowl, first beating the eggs into the ricotta individually, then as a free-for-all.
4. Pour wet ingredients into dry and mix minimally.
5. Fold in extra ingredients.
6. Bake 12--20 minutes depending on size, or to the toothpick test.  (Beware of melted chocolate chips when testing.)
7. Cool in pan until they're cool enough to twist and extract.

## Variants

I'm considering putting the mascarpone glaze from [these muffins](http://www.thechunkychef.com/bakery-style-thyme-blueberry-muffins-with-a-mascarpone-glaze/) on top, possibly with a change to the flavoring to make it more interesting---say, anise or orange extract.

Cut in half, that would be:

* 1/2 c. powdered sugar
* 1/2 tsp. extract
* 1 T. milk or half-and-half
* 1 T. mascarpone

Whisk until smooth and drizzle.
