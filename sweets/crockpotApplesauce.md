# Crockpot Applesauce

Crockpot applesauce is an easy and tasty use for our neighbors' unwanted apples.  See, for example, [the kitchn's recipe](http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-applesauce-in-the-slow-cooker-223486).  I've used a small crockpot for this but they recommended a large one.  You can freeze the results.

Makes 4 cups.

## Ingredients

* 6--8 medium apples (3 lbs), peeled and chopped
* 1 T. lemon juice
* 1/2 c. water
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 1 clove (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. salt

## Directions

1. Mix in a crockpot.
2. Cook on high for at least 4 hours, stirring occasionally.

## Variants

You can use 1 tsp. ground cinnamon if you don't have sticks.  You can add star anise or pie spices.

The Kitchn also provides Instant Pot directions.
