# Apple Crisp

This is a semi-traditional but non-dairy apple crisp recipe inspired by [Easy Paleo Apple Crisp](http://livingwellmom.com/2016/09/grain-free-apple-crisp/), plus some traditional apple crisp recipes like [this one at Epicurious](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/apple-crisp-51203860).  It is no longer the least bit paleo.

## Ingredients

### Apple

* 4 small-to-medium apples, peeled and sliced thin
* 2 T. lemon juice
* 1/2 T. vanilla extract
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp. allspice
* 1/4 tsp. ground clove
* 1/2 c. walnuts, chopped (or raisins)
* 2 T. sweet red wine, sweet vermouth, or water (optional)

### Crisp

* 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
* 1/2 c. almond flour
* 1/2 c. brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/8 tsp. salt
* 1/4 c. coconut oil (or shortening, or butter)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â° (with convection).
2. Mix dry crisp ingredients, then work in the oil with your fingers.  Refrigerate.
3. Prep apple ingredients and mix in a bowl.
4. Fill a small baking dish (optionally greased or spray-oiled) with the apple mix.
5. Top with crumbled crisp mix.
6. Bake 40--50 minutes, or until browned and bubbly.

## Variants

The original recipe called for pecans.

Epicurious says you can make it a day ahead and reheat it.
