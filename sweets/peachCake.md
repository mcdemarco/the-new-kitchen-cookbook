# Peach Cake

The new kitchen still lacks a springform pan or any other sort of cake pan, so when I found myself with a peck of picked peaches I went searching for a recipe to fit my pans.  [A Farmgirl's Dabbles](https://www.afarmgirlsdabbles.com/perfect-peach-cake/#recipe) in peach cake fit the bill, and this recipe has been modified from that one and my [cupcake recipe](../sweets/cupcakes.md).

Serves 8--12.

## Ingredients

### Wet

* 1 1/3 sticks butter, softened
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/2 c. brown sugar
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 tsp almond extract (optional)
* 1 c. buttermilk
* 3 c. peeled chopped peaches (up to 1" chunks)

### Dry

* 2 c. white flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* scant 1/4 tsp salt

### Topping

* 1/4 c. sugar
* 1 tsp. cinnamon

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â° (with convection).
2. Butter or spray a 9" x 13" pan.
3. Mix dry ingredients in a small bowl and set aside.
4. Cream butter and brown sugar in a large bowl or a stand mixer.
5. Mix in eggs and extract(s).
6. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients and buttermilk, alternating between them and mixing well.
7. Beat until smooth, and/or cream using an immersion blender.
8. Fold in peaches.
9. Pour into pan and spread as necessary.
10. Mix the topping ingredients.  Sprinkle evenly over the top.
11. Bake 40--45 minutes, or to the toothpick test.

Cooling is optional.

## Variants

I used a glass casserole; the original recipe says it's quicker in a metal pan.

Peter accidentally bought fat-free buttermilk.  It was hard to find the appropriate substitution, but I found some info on [a website about reconstituting powdered milk](https://www.usaemergencysupply.com/information-center/all-about/all-about-dehydrated-dairy/turning-your-non-fat-powdered-milk-into-whole-reconstituted-milk) and decided to replace 1 T. of deficient buttermilk with oil per cup.
