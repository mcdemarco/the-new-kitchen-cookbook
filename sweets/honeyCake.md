# Honey Cake

The new kitchen still lacks a springform pan or any other sort of cake pan, so it's fortunate that loaf pans are allowed for honey cake.  [Smitten Kitchen](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/09/majestic-and-moist-honey-cake/) reinterpreted Marcy Goldman's recipe, and I have reinterpreted it here.

Makes 2--3 loaves.


## Ingredients

### Dry

* 3 1/3 c. flour
* 1 3/4 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 4 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp clove
* 1/2 tsp allspice

### Wet

* 3 eggs
* 1 c. pure olive oil (or any neutral oil)
* 1 c. honey
* 1 1/2 c. sugar
* 1/2 c. brown sugar
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 c. warm coffee
* 1/2 c. apple cider
* 1/4 c. rye or whiskey

### Topping

* sanding sugar


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â° (with convection).
2. Spray two 9" x 5" loaf pans (or three 8" x 4" loaf pans) **and** line with parchment paper.
3. Mix dry ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer.
4. Make a well and pour in the liquid ingredients.
5. Mix well, using a whisk attachment.
6. Pour batter into the pans.
7. Optionally top with sanding sugar.
8. Bake on a heavy baking sheet for about an hour.
9. Do a toothpick test.


## Variants

The original recipe called for orange juice.  You can replace the scary liquids with more juice or cider.

You can replace the spices with [pumpkin spice](../appetizers/pumpkinSpice.md).

The original recipe lists a variety of pans you can use instead of loaf pans, and adjustments to the cooking time.
