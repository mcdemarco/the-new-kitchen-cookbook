# Candied Grapefruit Peels

I keep my leftover peels in the freezer until I have enough to candy.

## Ingredients

* 3 whole grapefruit peels (presumably halved)
* 1 c. sugar
* 1/2 c. water

## Directions

Boil peels in cold water whole and drain them, twice.  Cut them into strips.  Boil the strips six more times, starting with cold water each time.

Dissolve sugar in 1/2 c. water on heat.  Cook peels slowly in the water until only 2 T. syrup remains.

Roll in sugar and cool on a greased cookie sheet.

## Variants

You can do this with (four) oranges, but I prefer grapefruit.
