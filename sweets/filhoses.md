# Filhoses de Abóbora (Portuguese Pumpkin Fritters)

Come Hanukkah I'm always looking for new things to fry.  *Filhoses de abóbora*, also known as *sonhos de abóbora* or *beilhoses*, are a Portuguese Christmas tradition that sounded perfect, at least in Portuguese.  Then I went looking for a recipe that used a can of pumpkin rather than a long pumpkin cooking and draining process.  The problem with those recipes was that they used much, much more flour than doing it the hard way.  For example, [this handy PDF](https://portuguesebaking.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Filhoses-de-abobora-class-recipe.pdf) from the Portuguese Baking School uses more than four times more flour than pumpkin(by weight), while this "[easy Portuguese recipe](https://www.easyportugueserecipes.com/fried-pumpkin-cakes-filhoses-de-abobora/)" uses the traditional trace of flour (24 times more pumpkin than flour).

Fortunately, I found a happy marriage of a can of pumpkin and a trace amount of flour [on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/myportuguesekitchen/photos/some-of-you-asked-for-sonhos-de-abóbora-recipe-translates-to-pumpkin-dreams-so-h/1136261261401674/), and this recipe started with that.  Thank you, Margaret, and your Portuguese kitchen.

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 1 can (425g) pumpkin 
* 1/4 c. (43g) sugar
* 1 T. Triple sec (optional)
* 2 T. orange juice or milk
* zest of 1/2 orange
* 1 egg
* 1 1/8 c. (145g) flour
* 1 tsp. baking powder
* 1 tsp. pumpkin spice (optional)
* dash salt (optional)

### Nuts

* oil for frying
* granulated sugar and cinnamon to taste for rolling

## Directions

1. Mix the flour, baking powder, and spices and set aside.
2. In a blender or [KitchenAid], cream the rest of the dough ingredients.
3. If in a blender, move the dough to a bowl.  
4. Gradually add the flour mixture while beating with a whisk or whisk attachment.
5. Heat four inches of oil to 350°F. 
6. Drop the dough with a small scoop or tablespoons.  
7. Turn them over once when the underside becomes golden brown.
7. When the other side is golden brown, remove to a rack or paper towels.
8. Roll in cinnamon sugar. 

## Variants

The alcohol was supposed to be brandy.  Port wine is also a popular choice.

You can shallow-fry them if you prefer.  You can also turn them more frequently.

Some recipes are quite eggy with no other liquid, for example [Filhoses de abóbora à moda de Trás-os-Montes](https://www.vortexmag.net/filhoses-de-abobora-a-moda-de-tras-os-montes-receita-tradicional-que-sai-sempre-bem/).
