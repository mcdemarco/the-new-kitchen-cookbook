# Haroset

This is a passover recipe based on [Traditional Apple-Walnut Charoset](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/traditional-apple-walnut-charoset-234298), much altered by changes suggested in the comments.  I later cut it down because it made a lot of leftovers.

Makes 1 1/3 or 4 cups.

## Ingredients 

### Small Batch

* 1 apple (granny smith, gala/braeburn, fuji, macintosh, janathon), peeled and diced
* 1/2 c. walnuts, toasted and chopped
* a few pine nuts, toasted and chopped (optional)
* up to 1/4 c. sweet red wine or sweet vermouth
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* golden raisins (see variants for substitutions)
* orange zest (optional)
* lemon juice (optional)

### Large Batch

* 3 mixed apples (granny smith, gala/braeburn, fuji, macintosh, janathon), peeled and diced
* 1 1/2 c. walnuts, toasted and chopped
* handful pine nuts, toasted and chopped (optional)
* 1/2 c. sweet red wine or sweet vermouth
* 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* golden raisins (see variants for substitutions)
* orange zest (optional)
* lemon juice (optional)

## Directions

Mix.

## Variants

Grind it up in a food processor instead of dicing.

Optionally, substitute 1 T. honey or 1 T. brown sugar caramelized a bit (e.g., with water in a microwave) for the raisins.

Substitute a sweet white wine for the sweet red.

Substitute hazelnuts or pecans for walnuts.

Add horseradish or cayenne to taste.

Add coconut.

Variants of other recipes: add pine nuts, chestnuts, almonds, ground almond, dates, [figs, 2 pears](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12346-pear-haroseth-with-pecans-and-figs), prunes, ground clove, ground ginger, nutmeg, and/or sugar.  (A lot of these are in the Haroset from Italy recipe in Claudia Roden's *Book of Jewish Food*.)
