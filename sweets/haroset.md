# Haroset

This is a passover recipe based on [Traditional Apple-Walnut Charoset](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/traditional-apple-walnut-charoset-234298), much altered by changes suggested in the comments.

## Ingredients

* 3 mixed apples (granny smith, gala/braeburn, fuji, macintosh, janathon), diced
* 1 1/2 c. walnuts, toasted and chopped
* 1/2 c. sweet red wine
* 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* golden raisins (see variants for substitutions)
* orange zest (optional)
* lemon juice (optional)

## Directions

Mix.

## Variants

Grind it up in a food processor instead of dicing.

Optionally, substitute 1 T. honey or 1 T. brown sugar caramelized a bit (e.g., with water in a microwave) for the raisins.

Substitute a sweet white wine for the sweet red.

Substitute hazelnuts or pecans for walnuts.

Add horseradish or cayenne to taste.

Add coconut.
