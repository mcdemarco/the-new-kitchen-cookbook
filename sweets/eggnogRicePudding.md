# Eggnog Rice Pudding

This is a handy holiday recipe for leftover store-bought eggnog, which I googled when a mostly-undrunk carton of eggnog was about to expire.  I found a few copies of the same recipe, all unattributed; [this one](http://kitchenjoyblog.com/eggnog-rice-pudding/) had the best pictures.

The recipe can be made in a 2 quart pot, if you're careful.  Use a good, heavy-bottomed pot.

Total time: 45 minutes, plus optional chilling time

Serves 6--8.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 c. arborio rice or sushi rice
* 1 1/2 c. water
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 3 1/2 c. -- 4 c. eggnog
* 1/4 tsp. nutmeg

## Directions

1. Cook rice in water and salt normally, until most of the water is gone (about 12 minutes).
2. Add eggnog and nutmeg.
3. Cook for about 30 minutes over medium heat, stirring at least once a minute (more if you ignored the advice to use a good pan).

Stop after 30 minutes even if it still seems thin; it's done if the rice is floating around the pudding instead of sitting on the bottom.

Serve warm, room-temperature, or chilled, decorated with additional nutmeg.

## Variants

Fry the rice in butter (like risotto) before starting.

Add 1/2 c. dried cranberries, chopped candied cherries, currants, or raisins at the end.
