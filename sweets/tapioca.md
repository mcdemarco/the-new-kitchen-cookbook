# Tapioca Pudding

This is a coconut milk tapioca pudding from one of those giant Indian cookbooks.  I have increased it from the original recipe up to one can of coconut milk.  It's especially handy for Passover.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/9 c. tapioca
* water for soaking
* 3 1/3 c. water for cooking
* 1 1/4 c. sugar
* pinch salt
* 1 2/3 c. (1 can) coconut milk
* tropical fruits (optional)
* rind of 1 lime (optional)

## Directions

Soak tapioca in water for 1 hour.  Drain.  Boil cooking water.  Stir in sugar and salt.  Add tapioca and coconut milk.  Simmer 10 minutes.  Serve warm or cold, decorated with optional ingredients.
