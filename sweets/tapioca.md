# Tapioca Pudding

This is a coconut milk tapioca pudding from one of those giant Indian cookbooks.  I have increased it from the original recipe up to one can of coconut milk.  It's especially handy for Passover.

The recipe can be made in a 2 quart pot, if you're careful.

Total time: 1 1/2 hours

Serves 8--10.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/9 c. tapioca
* water for soaking
* 3 1/3 c. water for cooking

* tropical fruits (optional)
* rind of 1 lime (optional)

## Directions

1. Soak tapioca in water for 1 hour.
2. Drain.
3. Boil cooking water.
4. Stir in sugar and salt, then add tapioca and coconut milk.
5. Simmer 10 minutes.

Serve warm or cold, decorated with optional ingredients.
