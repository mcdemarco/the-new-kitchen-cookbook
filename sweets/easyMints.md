# Easy Mints

This recipe came off a bag of Domino's sugar.

Yield:  1 lb.

## Ingredients

* 1/4 c. butter or margarine
* 2 T. water
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp peppermint extract
* 3 1/2 - 3 3/4 c. confectioner's sugar
* food coloring (optional)

## Directions

Melt butter with water over low heat.  Remove from heat, add salt and extract.  Gradually add sugar.

If using food coloring, separate mixture for coloring and color each part with "several drops."

Knead until smooth.  Mold with molds or roll and slice.  (I just rolled into balls instead.)

The directions were vague about whether they keep.
