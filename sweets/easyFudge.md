# Almond Easy Fudge

This is an even easier easy fudge, with just the basic ingredients from [Eagle Brand](http://www.eaglebrand.com/recipes/details/?RecipeId=4139), along with my addition of some almond extract.

## Ingredients

* 3 c. (18 oz.) semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1 can (14 oz.) sweetened condensed milk
* dash salt
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 tsp almond extract

## Directions

Line an 8x8 pan as in the previous fudge recipe.  Mix all ingredients but extracts in a double boiler until melted and smooth.  Add extract.

Pour into pan and smooth with a spatula.  Chill two hours.  Cut into desired size.
