# Sufganiyot ("Jelly" Doughnuts)

This recipe is adapted from various online recipes for yeast sufganiyot, such as [Bon Appetit's](http://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/strawberry-sufganiyot), [Epicurious's](http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/sufganiyot-40003), and [Leite's](http://leitesculinaria.com/60367/recipes-hanukkah-jelly-doughnuts-sufganiyot.html) (which needed halving).  The jelly is in scare quotes because I left it out.  I also skipped any proofing steps that might have been mentioned in my sources.

There are non-dairy ingredient options to make the doughnuts non-dairy, but my frying oil was already dairy from making sonhos, so I didn't try that.  There is a break for (presumably overnight) refrigeration described at Leite's, if you need one.

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 2 1/2 c. flour (plus more as necessary)
* 3/4 c. warm milk or water
* 2 1/4 tsp. yeast (1 envelope)
* 1 egg
* 1/4 c. sugar
* 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/4 c. butter or oil
* 3/4 tsp. salt

### Nuts

* oil for frying
* granulated (1/3--1/2 c.) or confectioner's sugar for dusting
* jelly for decorating (optional)

## Directions

1. Mix all dough ingredients except flour and (optionally) butter.  Optionally, pause for any yeast superstitions you may hold.
2. Add flour gradually and knead to make a smooth dough.
3. If using butter instead of oil, knead it in at this point.
4. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 hour.
5. Form into golf-ball-sized balls, cover with whatever, and let rise 1/2 hour.
6. Heat oil 4 inches of oil at somewhere between 350° and 385°F (the recipes varied dramatically on this point).
6. Flatten slightly and fry about 1 minute per side (turning over halfway through) until brown.
7. Drain on or over paper towels.
8. Roll in sugar.  Optionally top with a small spoonful of jelly.


## Variants

I haven't tried these variants, but they sound interesting.

* Add 1 tsp. cinnamon to the dough.
* Add 1/2 tsp. zest to the dough.
* Replace some liquid with brandy or orange juice (also see Sfenj in The Book of Jewish Food).

For a savory variant, see the Lamb and Mushroom Sufganiyot recipe by Sagi Azulay in [Tablet Magazine](https://www.tabletmag.com/recipes-2/219522/lamb-and-mushroom-sufganiyot), also at [Grow and Behold](https://blog.growandbehold.com/recipes/lamb-and-mushroom-sufganiyot/).  I tried it and found it too bready, maybe because I skipped the whole tahini step.  Note that it uses crazy amounts of instant dry yeast, for which I substituted double the usual amount of active dry yeast, combined in the usual active dry yeast way instead of the order in the recipe.
