# Nutella Fudge with Sea Salt

I found this chocolate fudge recipe online at [The Crunchy Mamacita](http://thecrunchymamacita.blogspot.com/2011/12/nutella-fudge-with-sea-salt.html), who had gotten it from [Cookin' Canuck](http://www.cookincanuck.com/2010/12/chocolate-nutella-fudge-with-sea-salt/).  I found the crunchy version a bit more approachable, but I've edited out some unnecessary room-temperaturing and the instructions for making your own fake double boiler (since I have a real double boiler).  I also assume you don't need to know which end of the double boiler the water goes into and which end takes the fudge.

I had my eye on an [Andes Mint Chocolate Chip Fudge](http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2012/10/20/andes-mint-chocolate-chip-fudge/), but I thought I had all the ingredients for this one (and certain people just don't appreciate mint properly).  Then it turned out the can of milk was evaporated milk, not sweetened condensed milk, and Peter had eaten almost all the Nutella.  So I went shopping and found everything on sale, including the dark chocolate chips and coarser sea salt than I had at home.

## Ingredients

* 1 can (14oz) sweetened condensed milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 8 oz Nestle dark chocolate chips (53% cacao) or other high-cacao semisweet chips
* 1 c. Nutella
* 3 T. butter cut up into small pieces
* coarse sea salt to sprinkle on top

## Directions

Line 64 square inches of baking pan or convenient rectangular tupperware with parchment paper.  Leave some overlap for later fudge extraction.  (I used two 8x4 pans because my 8x8 pan has only been fit for steaming bread since an unfortunate accident with a fish.)

In the double boiler at a gentle simmer, mix all ingredients but sea salt.  Stir until melted and smooth, about 5-7 minutes.

Pour into pan(s) and smooth out with a spatula.  Sprinkle with sea salt.  Press sea salt into fudge to secure it.  Chill until firm (at least 2 hours).

Lift the fudge out of the pan(s) and cut into fudge-sized pieces.  (The directions said 3/4 inch, but I think an inch is more fudge-sized.)  You can either rinse the knife frequently or knock off the extra fudge buildup on your cut lines later.

Keep the parchment paper to separate the fudge from your tupperware, tin foil, snack baggies or other fudge containment schemes.  Keep refrigerated.
