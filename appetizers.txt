## Freak Out for Frico!

I saw a couple of contestants making [frico](http://thecocinamonologues.com/2012/04/03/freak-out-for-frico/) out of aged cheddar on Chopped and decided to make a sampler of Parmesan, Romano, and aged cheddar fricos. They didn't last long enough to photograph.

### Directions

Grate cheese.  Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Arrange cheese in several piles on paper.  Bake six to eight minutes at 350°.

## Devilled Eggs with Capers

I spotted these at a party and thought they were much yummier with the capers.  Directions: make deviled eggs; top with capers.

## Roasted Chickpeas

Below is [the recipe](http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2008/02/crispy-roasted-chickpeas-garbanzo-beans.html) I got my Moroccan Spice Mix from (see the Veggies chapter).  Here's another chickpea link: [15 More Ways to Flavor Roasted Chickpeas](http://www.thekitchn.com/15-more-ways-to-flavor-roasted-106112).

* 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. Moroccan Spice Mix
* 1/4 tsp. kosher salt to taste
