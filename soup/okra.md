# Okra Soup

We had some fresh okra, cooked wild rice, store-bought chicken stock, and leftover chicken shreds lying around, so I made up a soup out of it.  It turned out to be a traditional way to prepare okra, though not one I'd tried before.  I really liked the effect of transferring the slime from the okra to the stock.

## Ingredients

* 3 1/2 c. chicken stock
* 1/2 c. water
* 1/2 lb. okra, sliced
* 1--2 carrots, sliced
* 1/2 c. cooked wild rice
* 3/4 c. cooked chicken chunks
* salt to taste

## Directions

1. Boil stock.
2. Cook the raw veggies in the stock to taste, about 10 minutes.
3. Add the remaining ingredients.
4. Warm through (about 5 minutes).

## Variants

Presumably regular rice would work as well as wild rice, and some celery wouldn't hurt.

Traditional okra soups also include onion, garlic, red pepper, black pepper, and tomato.
