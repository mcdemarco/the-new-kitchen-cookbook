# Instant Pot Potato Leek Soup

My recipe is a combination of [a crockpot recipe's](https://www.thekitchn.com/slow-cooker-potato-leek-soup-recipe-256183) ingredients and [an Instant Pot recipe's](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-potato-leek-soup/) process.

Serves 2--3.

## Ingredients

* 2 T. olive oil
* 2 large leeks, sliced
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 c. vegetable broth
* 1 lb. potatoes, peeled and diced
* 1 tsp. fresh thyme or 1/2 tsp. dried
* 1 bay leaf or 1/4 tsp. ground bay
* 1 T. fish or soy sauce (optional)
* 1 T. salt (or more if omitting soy sauce)
* pepper to taste (optional)
* 1/4 c. sour cream

## Directions

1. Prepare leeks in the usual way, season with salt and pepper, and sauté in oil (on the Sauté setting).
2. Add garlic and remaining spices and sauté 1 minute.
3. Cancel Sauté and add all remaining ingredients except the sour cream.
4. Close Instant Pot, seal vent, and cook at high pressure for 5 minutes with natural release.
5. Stir in sour cream, and optionally blend with an immersion blender.

Serve immediately.

## Variants

It's similar but much slower in a crockpot.

Chicken stock is sometimes called for, and almost always the cream is heavy rather than sour, with more of it.

The butter was replaced with olive oil.
