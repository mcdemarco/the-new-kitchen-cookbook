# Gazpacho

It was a crazy heat wave and Peter wanted some gazpacho, so I based this recipe on [Alton Brown's](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/gazpacho-recipe-1937573).  His had basil leaves for the decoration.

Serves 3--4.

## Ingredients

* 2 lbs. vine tomatoes
* 1/2 cucumber
* 1/2 yellow pepper
* 1/2 of a red onion
* 1 small jalapeño pepper
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/4 olive oil
* juice of 1 lime
* 2 tsp. balsamic vinegar
* 2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce
* 1/2 tsp. ground cumin
* 1 tsp. salt
* black pepper to taste
* cilantro to decorate (optional)

## Directions

1. Slit and blanch the tomatoes for 15 seconds to make them easier to peel.  (I probably would have skipped this step if we weren't also having pasta.)
2. Cool and peel tomatoes.
3. Mince jalapeño and garlic and set aside.
4. Dice all remaining veggies and add all remaining ingredients except the spicy set-aside.
5. Mix.  Remove a token quantity of veggies to provide texture later and set aside.
6. Add the spicy set-aside to the main bowl and puree with an immersion blender.
7. Mix in the textured set-aside and chill to taste.
8. Serve topped with cilantro leaves.
