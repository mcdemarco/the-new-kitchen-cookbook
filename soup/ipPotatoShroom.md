# Instant Pot Potato Mushroom (Chicken) Soup

Potato mushroom is a popular vegetarian soup combo, but due to demands for *meat meat meat* this one includes chicken.  Most inspired by Raia's [Chunky Chicken Potato Soup in the Instant Pot](https://raiasrecipes.com/2024/11/chunky-chicken-potato-soup.html).  As usual, I tossed the chicken in still frozen.

Serves 2--4.

## Ingredients

* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 medium onion, chopped
* 1--2 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 1/2 c. chicken broth
* 3 chicken thighs
* ~5 russet potatoes, peeled and diced
* chopped portabella mushrooms to taste
* 1 tsp. fresh dill
* 1 tsp. dried parsley
* 1 tsp. oregano
* 1 bay leaf or 1/4 tsp. ground bay
* 1/2 tsp. [Ras el Hanout](../appetizers/moroccanSpiceMix.md) (optional)
* generoun dash smoked paprika
* dash cayenne
* salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Sauté onions in the oil (on the Sauté setting) until limp.
2. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute.
3. Optionally, remove sofrito and set aside.
4. Either way, sauté mushrooms until soft.
5. Optionally, set aside mushrooms add sauté chicken for 5 minutes.
6. Cancel Sauté and add all remaining ingredients.
7. Close Instant Pot, seal vent, and cook at high pressure for 20 minutes with natural release.
8. Shred chicken and return to pot.

## Variants

You can add diced celery, green pepper, and/or other sofrito ingredients to the onion step.

The original recipe lacked meat but included butter and sour cream.

I saw one recipe that removed the mushrooms after sautéing, adding them back in after pressure cooking.
