# Cold Zucchini Soup

This is a more flexible version of the already flexible [Zucchini Basil Soup (Parve)](https://www.thespruceeats.com/zucchini-basil-soup-2122312) from the Spruce.  It can also be served warm.

Serves 8--12.

## Ingredients

* 3 T. olive oil
* 2--3 onions (chopped)
* 5 cloves garlic (chopped)
* 2--3 lbs. medium zucchini (chopped)
* 1 c. fresh basil, packed 
* dried parsley to taste
* 4--5 c. stock
* salt to taste
* black pepper to taste 
* other spices to taste (curry, etc.)
* fresh herbs to garnish

## Directions

1. Fry the onion and garlic in the oil in a stock pot.
2. Add the zucchini for 5 minutes.
3. Add basil, stock, and parsley.
4. Simmer 30 minutes.
5. Puree with an immersion blender.  Water down (or ice down) at this point if desired.
6. Season.
7. Chill and/or serve.

## Variants

I actually make it with beef broth.

You can cook the vegetables in a smaller pot with less broth, then add the remaining broth or water down later.
