# Instant Pot Stock

This works for a turkey or chicken carcass, or a collection of chicken bones.

I did make stock with approximately the ingredients below before I got an instant pot, but [the internet says](https://www.seriouseats.com/ask-the-food-lab-can-i-make-stock-in-a-pressure-cooker-slow-cooker) that the Instant Pot method is better than stovetop or crockpot.  I merged my more freeform recipe with [Bon Appétite's](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/instant-pot-chicken-stock) Instant Pot chicken stock recipe to get the quantities below.

## Ingredients

* 1 bird carcass, or a similar quantity of bones
* 1 onion, quartered
* 1 head garlic, sliced through the equator
* 1 tsp. peppercorns
* 2 tsp. salt
* generous dash celery seed (or 1 stalk celery)
* 1 carrot, scrubbed (optional)
* other vegetable scraps and/or herbs, as desired
* water

## Directions

1. Add all ingredients to pot.
2. Fill with water to the fill line or so.
3. Close pot and vent, and pressure cook on high for one hour.
4. Wait for natural pressure release and let cool.
5. Strain.

## Variants

Most recipes cut the time down to 40 minutes.

Cooling the pot in an ice bath may have been recommended in the source recipe.

I recycle the onion and spices that I often "stuff" the bird with.  I've seen recipes that sauté the bones first, but I doubt I will ever make the effort to do so.  

You can do the same with beef or other meat bones, possibly adjusting the spices.  I never have enough to do so.
