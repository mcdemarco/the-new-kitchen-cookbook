# Sopa de Grao

This is a recipe for Portuguese Spinach & Chickpea Soup from Recipezaar (#189046).  It's likely I've always made it with vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.


## Ingredients

* 4 c. chickpeas (2 cans or about 1 pound of dried if you are using them)
* 3 or more large garlic cloves, chopped 
* 3 large yellow onions, peeled and coarsely chopped
* 5 T. olive oil
* 2 potatoes, peeled and coparsely chopped (Yukon gold)
* 2 T. fresh parsley, minced
* 2 T. fresh cilantro, minced
* 1 tsp dried marjoram, crumbled
* 4 c. chicken or vegetable broth
* 3/4 lb spinach, chopped (fresh or frozen)
* up to 2 T. fresh lemon juice 
* 1 1/2 tsp coarse salt (or to taste)
* 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper (or to taste)

## Directions

Fry the garlic and onions in 3 tablespoons of oil at the bottom of your stockpot until translucent.  Add the potatoes and fry 2 to 3 minutes. Add the herbs and cook a bit at low.

Add the broth and bring to a simmer.  Add the chickpeas, cover and cook slowly for about one hour or until everything is soft.

If you like your soup to have texture, ladle out a cup or so of chick peas and set aside.
Using an immersion blender, puree the remaining soup to taste.
Add in the spinach and any reserved chickpeas and simmer 20-30 minutes.

Lastly, stir in lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste and serve, hot, with crusty bread.

## Variants

Cook 1 package soy chorizo according to package directions.  Slice to bite-sized and add it to the soup at the spinach stage.  (I used [this one](https://lightlife.com/product/smart-sausages-chorizo/), which I found at Market Basket.  It's in the solid style, not crumbly like Trader Joe's soy chorizo, and spices up the soup quite a bit.)

Alternately, add crushed red pepper to taste early on for spicing up.
