* 1 can (15 oz) tomatoes
* 1--2 c. chicken broth (depending on desired soupiness)
* 1 T. pesto or 1 T. olive oil and fresh or dried basil to taste
* 1/2 tsp. pure chili powder (optional)
* 1 tsp. smoked paprika
* 1 tsp. ground coriander
* heaping 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes
* dash oregano
* dash sage
* black pepper to taste
* salt to taste

## Directions

1. Toss it all in an Instant Pot.
2. Close Instant Pot, seal vent, and press the Soup button or set to Manual/high for 10 minutes.
3. Release naturally.

## Variants

You can add some soup-sized pasta, but be sure to add broth to compensate.

You can reduce broth in favor of more tomatoes.

Feel free to saute (on low) the onions and garlic in the oil while assembling other ingredients.
