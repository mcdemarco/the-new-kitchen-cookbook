# Soup

I used to make more soup than I do now.  I should get back to it since soup goes so well with winter and bread.

Most of my soup recipes are (continental) Portuguese.


## Vegetarian Portuguese Kale Soup

Yet another Recipezaar recipe, #149098.  Portuguese kale soup usually includes chouri√ßo and morcela (blood pudding).

### Ingredients

* 1 T. olive oil
* 1 T. finely chopped garlic
* 1/2 c. diced onion
* 1/2 c. diced turnip
* 1/2 c. diced carrot
* 1 bunch curly or dinosaur kale, stemmed and roughly chopped
* 6 ounces soy chorizo, chopped
* 3 bay leaves
* 3 T. chopped fresh parsley leaves
* 2 T. chopped fresh thyme leaves
* 6 c. vegetable stock
* 1 c. kidney bean
* 3/4 c. diced tomato (6 ounces)
* 2 medium potatoes, diced

### Directions

In a large stockpot, fry the garlic, onions, turnips and carrots in the oil for 5 minutes. Add the kale, chorizo, bay leaves, parsley and thyme and mix well. Add the stock, beans and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then simmer for 30 to 40 minutes.  You can cook the potatose separately or with the soup.

Remove the bay leaves to serve.



## Fresh Potato and Cilantro Soup

This is another Portuguese recipe (Sopa de Coentro), from [Soupsong](http://www.soupsong.com/rpotato2.html).

### Ingredients

* 4 onions, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 4 T. olive oil
* 4 potatoes, peeled and chopped
* 6 cups vegetable or chicken stock
* salt to taste
* 1/4 tsp cayenne
* 3/4 c. chopped cilantro

### Directions

In a large saucepan, saute the onions and garlic in 3 T. of the oil for 5 minutes, until limp.  Add the remaining oil and the potatoes. Fry for a minute. Add the stock, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes. Remove from heat and (optionally) puree.

Return the soup to the pot, season with salt and cayenne, and add the cilantro. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours. You can serve the soup cold--or reheat.  Top with cilantro or chives.



## Sopa de Grao

This is a recipe for Portuguese Spinach & Chickpea Soup from Recipezaar (#189046).  It's likely I made it with vegetable stock instead of chicken stock.


### Ingredients

* 4 c. chickpeas (2 cans or about 1 pound of dried if you are using them)
* 3 or more large garlic cloves, chopped 
* 3 large yellow onions, peeled and coarsely chopped
* 5 T. olive oil
* 2 potatoes, peeled and coparsely chopped (Yukon gold)
* 2 T. fresh parsley, minced
* 2 T. fresh cilantro, minced
* 1 tsp dried marjoram, crumbled
* 4 c. chicken or vegetable broth
* 3/4 lb spinach, chopped (fresh or frozen)
* up to 2 T. fresh lemon juice 
* 1 1/2 tsp coarse salt (or to taste)
* 1/4 tsp fresh ground pepper (or to taste)

### Directions

Fry the garlic and onions in 3 tablespoons of oil at the bottom of your stockpot until translucent.  Add the potatoes and fry 2 to 3 minutes. Add the herbs and cook a bit at low.

Add the broth and bring to a simmer.  Add the chickpeas, cover and cook slowly for about one hour or until everything is soft.

If you like your soup to have texture, ladle out a cup or so of chick peas and set aside.
Using an immersion blender, puree the remaining soup to taste.
Add in the spinach and any reserved chickpeas and simmer 20-30 minutes.

Lastly, stir in lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste and serve, hot, with crusty bread.
