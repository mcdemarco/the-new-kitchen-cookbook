# Fish

## Costco Salmon

Costco has big bags of single portions of frozen boneless, skinless salmon.  The instructions on the back say to defrost in running cold water for 20 minutes, but I defrost in still cold water for 30 minutes. 

I coat the salmon in a bit of olive oil and sprinkle with salt, dill, thyme, and tarragon.  The instructions say to cook 15-20 minutes at 350°, but I find that even 15 minutes is consistently too much.  I haven't determined the correct cooking time, though.

## Baked Mackerel

We got some frozen whole mackerel from Market Basket, but cleaning them was too much work for Peter.

### Ingredients

* 1 3/4 lbs bag frozen whole mackerel
* salt
* garlic powder
* paprika
* powdered safflower (a Portuguese spice)
* thyme or mustard powder

### Directions

Clean mackerel. Oil fillets and spice flesh side. Place on parchment paper (on baking sheet) skin side up. Bake 10-12 minutes at 400°.

## Fish Kuku

![fish kuku](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/fish_kuku.jpg)

Fish quiche. This is a variant recipe from the _New Food of Life_ cookbook (Meat Kuku, p. 102), also adjusted in size to fit the amount of fish I had. The original recipe called for the equivalent of 1 1/2 c. fresh parsley, 2/3 c. fresh chives, 2/3 c. of oil, and yogurt on the side, but since I didn't have it with me at the store I didn't grab those. (It's always parsley; I should have known.)

### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 lb whitefish fillets (haddock)
* 3 onions, sliced thin
* handful of freeze-dried parsley
* handful of freeze-dried chives
* 1 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/3 tsp. black pepper
* 7 eggs
* 1/3 tsp. salt
* 1/3 tsp. cinnamon
* 1 1/2 tsp. curry powder
* olive oil for the pans

### Directions

Preheat oven to 350 F. Brown onions. Chop and brown fish. Mix both with the next three ingredients (or just mix all the cold ingredients together). Mix the eggs and remaining ingredients (except oil) in a separate bowl. Pour some oil into the bottom of a 10 inch pan and heat in the oven briefly. Mix fish and egg mixtures together and pour into the heated pan.

Bake 30 minutes. Add more oil to the top. Bake 20 more minutes or until brown.

## Salmon Poke

One of the first things I made in the new kitchen was the salmon poke recipe [from Sushi Day](http://sushiday.com/archives/2014/05/26/salmon-poke/).  I cut the salt in half for Peter's sake.

### Ingredients

* 3/4 to 1 lb. sushi-grade salmon, cubed
* 3 T. shoyu soy sauce
* 2 stalks green onion, chopped into rings
* 1 T. sesame oil
* 1 T. sesame seed
* 1/2 tsp. sea salt or to taste

### Directions

Mix.  Optionally refrigerate.  Serve.

## Sushi Rice

I made some sushi rice to go with the salmon poke. I used to make it with rice vinegar and mirin, but the price of real mirin has gone up so I don't just have it sitting around to toss on my avocado udon anymore. Sweetening sake is the most auspicious substitute, but my sake was still in storage so I made the following recipe up out of some recipes I found online. 

### Ingredients

* 1 c. sushi rice
* 1 1/3 c. water
* 2 T. rice vinegar
* 1 1/2 T. sugar
* 1 tsp. sea salt
* 1 T. white cooking wine

### Directions

Optionally, rinse the rice. (I forgot.) Bring the rice in the water to a boil.  Simmer 20 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the remaining ingredients in a small pan until they're mixed well. Mix it all together when done. Chill.
