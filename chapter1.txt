# Bread

I've made many breads and bread-like things, but my favorite is no-knead bread.  Why knead when you don't have to?  My no-knead source is Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day.  You can find the basic recipe online in the book's blog: [Master Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/04/27/great-coverage-in-the-week-magazine-but-there-was-one-little-problem).  Most of the variants I make involve substituting a cup of something else for a cup of white flour in the basic recipe:  a cup of rye flour (and some caraway seed) for rye bread; half a cup of rye flour and half a cup of white flour for "peasant" bread.

## Artisan Bread Index

The original version of Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day didn't have a useful index of which breads could be made from which doughs, and I couldn't find one online either. So I compiled my own. The page numbers are in parentheses. The variants must be mixed up separately. I've left out the non-bread recipes for now, since I usually ignore them.
