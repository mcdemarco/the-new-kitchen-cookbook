# Things To Cook

This is my to-do list.


## Appetizers and Snacks

[Anchovy onion butter](http://food52.com/recipes/26778-anchovy-onion-butter)

[Parmesan dip](https://www.thekitchn.com/entertaining-recipe-creamy-parmesan-dip-recipes-from-the-kitchn-187441)

## Soup

[Kreplach](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/kreplach-236219)

Sri Lankan Mulligatawny Soup:  I have some leftover turkey meat that would go well in one of the chicken versions.  Note that most Sri Lankan recipes put together the spices instead of specifying roasted curry powder, and most slow cooker/instant pot mulligatawnies are Indian-style, not Sri Lankan.
