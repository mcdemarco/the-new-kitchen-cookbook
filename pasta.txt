## Pasta with Anchovy Sauce

![bigoli](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/bigoli.jpg)

This recipe is derived from Bigoli in Salsa all'Ebraica con Acciuga from _The Book of Jewish Food_ by Claudia Rodin. I cut back on the anchovies (by half), but it's still a lot of anchovies for non-Italians. I usually forget or skip the pepper. I have never chopped the capers as instructed in the original recipe; maybe capers are bigger in Italy.

### Ingredients

* 1 lb orrechiette, preferably whole wheat
* 3 T. extra virgin olive oil
* 2-3 2 oz. cans anchovy fillets in oil
* 6 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 bunch Italian (flat-leafed) parsley, chopped
* a handful of capers
* pepper to taste

### Directions

Boil pasta with a dash of salt and drain. In a saucepan, heat garlic in oil just until the aroma rises. Add anchovies with their oil and stir until they dissolve a bit. Freshen pasta and mix with the sauce in a large bowl (or in the sauce pan, if it's large enough). Add parsley, pepper, and capers. Serve hot or cold.

This is another recipe for Peter; I still believe that ground beef belongs in meatballs.

* pepper

* 1/4 tsp. crushed red pepper
* 1/4 tsp. cinnamon
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1 tsp paprika
* oregano
* basil

### Directions

Saut√© the onion, green pepper, and garlic in olive oil until soft. Add the beef and remaining spices and brown. Add the tomatoes and wine. Simmer to taste. Parboil the pasta and add to the meat. Simmer al dente.
