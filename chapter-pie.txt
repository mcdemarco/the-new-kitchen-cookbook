# Pie!

Yes, Pie is its own chapter.

## Crust

First, the crust.  My crusts all started from the basic crust recipe in my old Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook (which my sister said to use), but have been adjusted so I don't have to keep doing the math.  

I usually make a 9" pie with the 9" recipe, but if you're bad at rolling out dough (or you want leftovers), you should up it to the 10" recipe.

### Ingredients 

#### Single-crust pie shell

(This is half of the 10" double-crust pie recipe.)

* 1 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 2 1/2 - 3 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (8")

* 1 1/2 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 1/2 c. butter-flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 3 to 4 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (9")

(This should do for a 9" pie.)

* 1 3/4 c. flour 
* 1/2 c. + 1 T. + 1 tsp. butter flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 4-5 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (10")

* 2 c. flour 
* 1 tsp salt 
* 2/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 5-6 T. cold water

### Directions (All Crusts)

Mix flour & salt. Cut in shortening with a pastry cutter. When pieces are pea-sized, add water gradually until just damp. Squeeze into a ball and chill. 

Roll out between parchment paper and Saran Wrap. Peel one off (I've switched from peeling off the plastic first to peeling off the parchment first), flip into pie plate, peel the other one off carefully, and trim and/or roll under as desired.  I do the fork pinching thing.
