# About The New Kitchen Cookbook

My recipes were living in SpringPad when I discovered Penflip.  I thought they needed a bit more organization than SpringPad was giving them (and I wanted my recipe descriptions back that SpringPad had dropped for no reason), so I decided to turn them into a real book.  This is that book.  The title refers to my new kitchen(s): the one I moved into when I got married and its upcoming new incarnation once our renovations are done.

## Using the Cookbook

Some notes about the cookbook:  the recipes are all kosher, and many are non-dairy that would otherwise be dairy; they have been altered for reasons of kashrut and/or lactose intolerance.  No recipes have been altered to avoid salt, fat, trans fat, white flour, or sugar. I do have a tendency to omit black pepper and to fail to peel tomatoes even when instructed to do so.  (Or I comply and then eat the peels raw.)

Most of my recipes use olive oil instead of butter or other oils.  When I say olive oil in a recipe, I mean extra virgin olive oil unless specified otherwise.  (Some cookie recipes use pure olive oil.)  

Measurements are in American, temperatures are in Fahrenheit, and spoons and cups are all level.  Flour is fluffed (I shake up the jar), scooped, and leveled but not sifted.  Spices are dried unless fresh is specified.  A few measurements are omitted, usually because of cookbooks that just said to salt or pepper to taste.
