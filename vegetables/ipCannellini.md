# Instant Pot Cannellini

I defer to [the bean guy](https://www.dadcooksdinner.com/category/instant-pot-bean-recipes/) for making dried beans in the Instant Pot.  He swears they're better than canned, and cannellini is the one bean I actually keep around dry in case I ever run out of canned.  I have altered [the recipe](https://www.dadcooksdinner.com/instant-pot-cannellini-beans-marcella-beans/) a bit, so consult the original if you're a purist.

Makes 6 cups.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. dried cannellini
* 8 c. water
* 2 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* 1 tsp. rosemary
* 1 tsp. salt

## Directions

1. Add all ingredients to a six-quart instant pot.
2. Close lid and close vent.
3. Pressure cook on high for 35 minutes.
4. Release steam artificially.
5. Check for doneness.  If the beans are not done, either saute a bit or pressure cook for 5 minute intervals until done.

## Variants

For other types of beans, consult [the guy](https://www.dadcooksdinner.com/basic-technique-pressure-cooker-beans/). They are apparently not all the same.
