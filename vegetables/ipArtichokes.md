# Instant Pot Artichokes

I was going to make artichokes until I looked up the recipe and saw how long it takes.  My [Instant Pot] was full that day but the next day I put them in, following [the Spruce](https://www.thespruceeats.com/instant-pot-artichokes-4778442) for cooking times.

Makes 4 small artichokes.

## Ingredients

* 2--4 small artichokes
* 1 1/2 c. water
* 2 cloves garlic, sliced
* 1 bay leaf
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1 T. lemon juice

## Directions

1. Put all ingredients besides the artichokes in the pot.
2. Prep the artichokes to taste.  (Rinse, remove the stems, and optionally trim the tips off the sharp leaves.)
3. Insert the rack and place the artichokes upright on it.
4. Close vent and lid.
5. Pressure cook on high for 12 minutes.
6. Quick-release steam.

## Variants

Some people peel and eat the stems.  Peel and place them on the rack if you want them.
