# Carrot and Radish Salad

I googled quickly for something that would use up my lingering carrots and radishes and could be served not hot, but without shredding.  I made this one up out of a couple of other recipes, [Carrot Salad](http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/carrot-salad-114503) and [Roasted Radishes](http://www.miedemaproduce.com/category/all-recipes/radish-dishes).

## Dressing

* 1/4 tsp. ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp. ground ginger
* 1 T. toasted sesame oil
* 1 T. untoasted sesame oil
* 1 T. olive oil
* 2 T. soy sauce
* 1 T. lemon juice
* black pepper to taste

## Salad

* about 2 lbs. carrots
* about 15 radishes, halved or quartered
* chopped parsley to taste

## Directions

1. Trim, peel, and boil or roast carrots to desired tenderness.
2. Roast radishes 20--25 minutes at 420Â°.
3. Cool and chop carrots to a matching size.
4. Mix dressing and dress.
