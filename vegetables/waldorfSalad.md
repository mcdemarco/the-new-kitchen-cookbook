# Waldorf Salad

This is my interpretation of a traditional dish my mother was craving.  Of the many recipes I looked at, it ended up closest to [Crunchy Waldorf Salad](http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/crunchy-waldorf-salad).

## Ingredients

* 1 to 1 1/2 large green apples (granny smith, golden delicious, the neighbor's apples, or a mix)
* 1 tsp. lemon juice
* 2 stalks celery, diced or sliced
* 3/4 c. seedless grapes, cut in halves
* 1/4 c. currants
* 3/4 c. chopped walnuts
* about 1/2 c. mayonnaise
* pepper
* cinnamon
* nutmeg

## Directions

Toast walnuts 5 minutes at 350Â°; let cool.  Core and chop apples to bite size, and mix with lemon juice in an airtight container.  Chop grapes and celery; mix all ingredients.

## Variants

I used currants in place of raisins, but in traditional recipes only raisins appear, while in modern ones grapes entirely supplant the raisins.

Peter requested a substitution of allspice and clove for the cinnamon and nutmeg, which I plan to try out next time.  Some recipes substitute yogurt or cream for the mayonnaise, which Peter might also appreciate.
