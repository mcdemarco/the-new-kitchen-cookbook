# Roasted Cauliflower

This started as an Epicurious recipe from back when roasting cauliflower was all the rage.  I made a few additions and changed the temperature and times beyond recognition.

## Ingredients

* 1 medium cauliflower head cut into florets (2 1/2 to 3 pounds or 8 cups chopped)
* 2 T. extra-virgin olive oil
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed, and/or some sliced shallots
* 1/4 tsp salt
* turmeric to taste

## Directions

Toss all ingredients in a large bowl. Spread in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan. 
Roast at 425Â°, stirring occasionally, for about an hour or until golden brown.
