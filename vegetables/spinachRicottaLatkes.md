# Spinach Ricotta Latkes

This recipe comes mostly from [Jennie's Kitchen](http://www.injennieskitchen.com/2010/03/spinach-ricotta-potato-pancakes/), but I use far fewer homemade or home-grated ingredients.

## Ingredients

* 1 russet potato, peeled, grated, and squeezed latke-style
* 1/2 c. steamed spinach, squeezed, chopped and packed
* 1/2 c. whole milk ricotta
* 1 egg
* 2 T. grated parmesan
* pinch nutmeg
* salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Do the dance of icy grated potato according to your level of latke superstition.  Reserve any starch you produce.
2. Mix non-potato ingredients (optionally, ahead of time).
3. Drain and squeeze potato using a cheesecloth or towel.
4. Mix all ingredients, including any reserved starch.
5. Form a couple of tablespoons at a time into latke shape.
5. Fry in a small amount of oil in a non-stick pan, about 4 minutes on a side or until pleasantly browned.
6. Drain on a rack.

## Variants

I tried deep-frying a few like normal latkes, but that didn't work as well.

The original recipe did not call for the final latke squeeze, but I did it anyway.

The original recipe suggested sprinkling the cooked latkes with sea salt; I spaced that out completely.
