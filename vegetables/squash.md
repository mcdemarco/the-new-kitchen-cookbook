# Winter Squash

These are here so I don't have to google the directions every time I make them.  Cut them all in half first.

## Acorn Squash

Bake cut side up, filled with butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, etc., at 375° for 1 hour.

## Butternut Squash

Bake cut side down at 375° for 1 hour.

## Spaghetti Squash

Bake cut side down at 375° for 30-40 minutes.
