# Winter Squash

These are here so I don't have to google the directions every time I make them.  Cut them all in half first.

## Acorn Squash

Bake cut side up, filled with butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, [salt, pepper, and/ or garlic](https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-cook-acorn-squash-223015), etc., at 375° for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on size.

## Butternut Squash

Bake cut side down at 375° for 1 hour.
