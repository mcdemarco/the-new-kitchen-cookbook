# Roasted Rutabaga

I recently made [Sweet Potato Kale Salad with Cranberries, Walnuts, and Goat Cheese](https://www.queenofmykitchen.com/sweet-potato-kale-salad-with-cranberries-walnuts-and-goat-cheese/) because I happened to have all the ingredients.  I don't expect such a refrigerator conjunction again, but I did like the idea of quickly roasting sweet potato chunks on their own or for mixing into another vegetable.

## Ingredients

* rutabaga
* olive oil
* kosher salt
* thyme (optional)
* maple syrup (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â°.
2. Peel and cut the rutabaga into cubes.
3. Toss with other ingredients.
4. Arrange in a single layer on an edged cookie sheet.
5. Roast 30 minutes or to desired tenderness.
