# Roasted Brussel Sprouts

This recipe is a combination of the first thing the internet told me about roasting Brussel sprouts ([with grapes](https://simpletasty.recipes/14-easy-and-quick-brussel-sprout-recipes/)) and the second thing the internet told me ([with mushrooms](https://www.food.com/recipe/roasted-brussels-sprouts-with-mushrooms-488475)).  The internet was particularly unclear about the appropriate temperature.

## Ingredients

## Directions
