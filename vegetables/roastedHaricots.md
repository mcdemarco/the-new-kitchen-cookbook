# Roasted Green Beans

This recipe began life as [Oven Roasted Green Beans](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/oven-roasted-green-beans-recipe.html) by Emeril Lagasse.  But I think only the absence of garlic merits headline status in a vegetable recipe.

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

* fresh green beans for two
* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/2 tsp. black pepper

## Directions

1. Trim the beans.
2. Mix with oil, salt, and pepper.
3. Arrange in a single layer in a roasting pan.
5. Roast 15 minutes at 400Â°, stirring halfway through.

## Variants

Combine with roasted potatoes (during the last 15 minutes).
