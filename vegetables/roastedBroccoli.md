# Roasted Broccoli

This recipe began life as [Roasted Broccoli with Garlic](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchens/roasted-broccoli-with-garlic-recipe.html) from the Food Network, but I think only the absence of garlic merits headline status in a vegetable recipe.  It was influenced by my roasted haricots as well.

Serves 2--4.

## Ingredients

* 1--2 heads of broccoli
* 2 T. olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic, sliced
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt 
* 1/2 tsp. black pepper

## Directions

1. Cut the broccoli into florets and slice any extra stem you want to eat.
2. Mix with remaining ingredients.
3. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet or in a roasting pan.
5. Roast 15 minutes at 450° (425° with convection) without stirring.

## Variants

Combine with roasted potatoes (during the last 20 minutes).
