# Chickpea Salad with Fennel, Tomatoes and Olives

I got this recipe from my sister, who annotated it.  Further dialog is from her, with some edits for capitalization and the like.

## Dressing

(I usually double the dressing.)

* 1 T red wine vinegar
* 1 clove minced garlic
* 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard
* pepper (yeah, right)
* 3 T olive oil

Add first four  ingredients to bowl, whisk then whisk in olive oil. (I throw all in a small jar and shake.)

## Salad

* 2 c. cooked or canned chickpeas - rinsed (I use one can - the small chickpeas if you can find them)
* 1 small fennel bulb, halved vertically (remove hard core at bottom of bulb) then thinly sliced.  Reserve sprigs for garnish. (I skip the garnish.)
* 2 ripe tomatoes, diced
* 10 black olives (pitted and halved)
* 1/2 c. thinly sliced red onion
* 1/3 c. chopped fresh parsley (I skip this too; I have issues with parsley)

Toss all (except sprigs) in dressing; cover and let marinate in refrigerator 4 hours.

Serve with french bread and goat cheese or
with tuna or salmon (but not both 'cause that would be nasty).
