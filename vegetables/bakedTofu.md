# Crispy Baked Tofu

I adapted this slightly from [Simply Recipes' Easy Crispy Tofu](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/easy-crispy-tofu-recipe-5225495), mainly by ad-libbing some of the toppings.

## Ingredients

* 1 18 oz. package firm or extra-firm tofu
* 1 T soy sauce
* 1 tsp. neutral oil
* 1 tsp. sesame oil
* 1 tsp. rice vinegar
* mirin to taste
* 2 T cornstarch
* 2 T panko
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp. berbere (or another spice mix)

## Directions

1. Press the tofu in a kitchen towel between two appropriately-sized pans or cutting boards for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat oven to 425Â°.
3. Mix liquid ingredients in a medium bowl.
4. Mix dry ingredients in a small bowl.
5. Prepare a medium to large baking sheet with parchment paper *and* cooking spray.
6. Slice tofu into at least 24 cubes (*e.g.*, by cutting in half the long, skinny way and in quarters the other two ways).
7. Toss very gently in the liquid, preferably with a rubber spatula.
8. Sprinkle dry mix on top and mix gently again.
9. Spread tofu evenly on the baking sheet.
10. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown.

## Variants

The original recipe called for 1/2 tsp. sugar rather than mirin, and black pepper rather than spice mix.

There are a lot of recipes out there with other tricks, like salting the tofu to drain it.
