# Polenta

The internet recommends making your own polenta, but I had a tube of it from Trader Joe's and I wanted an easy side for a chicken that was already in the oven, so I did the following.

## Ingredients

* 1 tube polenta
* rosemary
* garlic powder
* salt
* red pepper flakes
* olive oil

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350Â° (with convection).
1. Generously oil a baking pan or cookie sheet.
2. Slice the polenta into 3/4" thick rounds.
3. Rub the slices around in the oil (both sides).
4. Sprinkle with spices.  (Go easy on the red pepper flakes if they're good ones.)
5. Bake 20--30 minutes.

## Variants

You can fry them in a pan, which I would have done if the oven weren't already going.

I've also spiced them with black pepper, black seed (nigella), sage, and/or savory.

The serving size of instant polenta is 1/4 c.  Boil a cup of water per 1/4 c. polenta, salt to taste, then cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly.  Cook longer if you want it thicker.  

You can also microwave a single serving of instant polenta on high for 4--5 minutes (stirring once), optionally with olive oil.  Consult the internet for larger quantities.
