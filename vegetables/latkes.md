# Latkes

Tori Avery has lots of [latke advice](http://toriavey.com/how-to/2013/11/how-to-make-crispy-latkes/).  This one is based on her panko recipe, but cut down a bit.

Makes: 14--16 latkes.

## Ingredients

* 1 2/3 lb. russet potatoes
* 1 medium onion
* 1/2 c. panko
* 1--2 eggs
* 2 tsp. potato starch (optional)
* salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Peel and grate potatoes into ice water.  Let sit 20 minutes.
2. Grate onion.
3. Remove potatoes to a colander.
4. Squeeze potatoes in a towel or cheesecloth to remove as much liquid as possible.
3. Pour off ice water, reserving the starch.
4. Combine all ingredients (including reserved or extra starch).
5. Squeeze latkes some more into latke-shape, 3 T. at a time.
6. Deep-fry 2--3 minutes per side at 365Â°.
7. Drain on a rack.

Serve hot.
