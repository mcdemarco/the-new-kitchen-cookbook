# Roasted Okra

I bought some okra at H-Mart even though Peter hates the slime, then I found [a list of slime-free okra recipes](http://localfoods.about.com/od/okra/tp/5-Easy-Okra-Recipes.htm).  I went with the [roasting recipe](http://localfoods.about.com/od/okra/r/Roasted-Okra.htm) because Peter enjoys roasted veggies even when I think I've roasted them a bit too long.

I cut the recipe down and changed the oil because the okra was going with Japanese food.

Serves 2--3.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 lb. fresh okra
* 1/2 T. sesame oil (or extra-virgin olive oil)
* 1 1/2 scallions total, preferably the whiter bits of 3 or 4 scallions
* 1/4 tsp. sea salt or to taste

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°.  If your okra needs washing, dry it well afterwards.  ![raw](../images/okra_raw.png)
2. Trim the tops off, then slice each okra in half lengthwise.
3. Chop the scallion to match in length.
3. Toss all ingredients in a large bowl.  ![sliced](../images/okra_sliced.png)
4. Spread in 1 layer in a shallow baking pan, optionally lined with parchment paper for your convenience.  ![spread](../images/okra_pan.png)
5. Roast about 25 minutes (or less, depending on size), stirring halfway through.

## Variants

I often omit the scallions and ad-lib other spices as in the images above.
