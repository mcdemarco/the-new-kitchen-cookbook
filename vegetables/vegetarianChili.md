# Vegetarian Chili

This chili is based on [Emeril's recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/vegetarian-chili-recipe.html), with some toning down because it was intended as the Good Kirk alternative to an Evil Kirk Texas chili.  The main modifications involved using some real chiles instead of dried chili powder, since I had them on hand for the evil version, plus sizing lots of things to the can rather than to cups.

## Ingredients

* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 1/2 c. onion, chopped
* 2 T. chopped garlic (5--6 cloves)
* 1 c. red bell pepper, chopped
* 1 scotch bonnet or several serranos, chopped
* chili puree, to taste
* 1 1/2 lbs. portabellas, cubed
* 1 zucchini, diced
* 1 can corn
* 2 cans black beans
* 1 1/2 cans canned tomatoes with their sauce (about 22 oz.)
* 1--2 tomatoes, chopped (optional)

* 1 T. cumin
* 1 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/4 c. chopped cilantro

* essence of Emeril (see my [Spicy Asian Chicken](../poultry/asianChicken.md) recipe for details)
