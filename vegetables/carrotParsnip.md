# North African Spiced Carrot and Parsnip Salad

I googled for something that would use up my lingering carrots and parsnips from the beef stew recipe, and I found this [Williams-Sonoma recipe](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/north-african-carrot-salad.html).  It has been rearranged for clarity.

I served it with Treda.


## Dressing

* 1/4 tsp. ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. ground coriander
* 1/4 tsp. ground cumin
* 1/8 tsp. ground ginger
* 1/4 c. lemon juice
* 1 T honey
* 3/4 tsp. harissa
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 6 T extra-virgin olive oil

Toast the first four spices in a tiny cast-iron skillet for about two minutes until fragrant, then let cool.
(Also, toast the pistachios for the salad in the same pan.)

Whisk together all ingredients except oil, then whisk in the oil slowly.

## Salad

* 3 large carrots (3/4 lb.), grated with a box grater
* 3 large parsnips (3/4 lb.), grated with a box grater
* 2/3 c. raisins
* 1/2 c. toasted pistachios, chopped
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* black pepper to taste

Note that parsnips are not as easy to grate as carrots.

Toss all in dressing and serve.

## Variants

The original recipe was topped with 1/4 chopped fresh cilantro or mint, which I didn't have.
