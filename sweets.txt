Here begins the sweet stuff.

## Tapioca Pudding

This is a coconut milk tapioca pudding from one of those giant Indian cookbooks.  I have increased it from the original recipe up to one can of coconut milk.

### Ingredients

* 1 1/9 c. tapioca
* water for soaking
* 3 1/3 c. water for cooking
* 1 1/4 c. sugar
* pinch salt
* 1 2/3 c. (1 can) coconut milk
* tropical fruits (optional)
* rind of 1 lime (optional)

### Directions

Soak tapioca in water for 1 hour.  Drain.  Boil cooking water.  Stir in sugar and salt.  Add tapioca and coconut milk.  Simmer 10 minutes.  Serve warm or cold, decorated with optional ingredients.

## Easy Mints

This recipe came off a bag of Domino's sugar.

### Ingredients

* 1/4 c. butter or margarine
* 2 T. water
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp peppermint extract
* 3 1/2 - 3 3/4 c. confectioner's sugar
* food coloring (optional)

### Directions

Melt butter with water over low heat.  Remove from heat, add salt and extract.  Gradually add sugar.

If using food coloring, separate mixture for coloring and color each part with "several drops."

Knead until smooth.  Mold with molds or roll and slice.  (I just rolled into balls instead.)

Yield is 1 lb.  The directions are vague about whether they keep.



## Candied Grapefruit Peels

You can do this with (four) oranges, but I prefer grapefruit.

### Ingredients

* 3 whole grapefruit peels (presumably halved)
* 1 c. sugar
* 1/2 c. water

### Directions

Boil peels in cold water whole and drain them, twice.  Cut them into strips.  Boil the strips six more times, starting with cold water each time.

Dissolve sugar in 1/2 c. water on heat.  Cook peels slowly in the water until only 2 T. syrup remains.

Roll in sugar and cool on a greased cookie sheet.
