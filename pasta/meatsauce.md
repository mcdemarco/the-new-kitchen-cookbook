This is the sauce that goes with the meatballs (see Meat). More than a pound of meat can overwhelm the sauce, but it will still cook and be yummy. Served with rigatoni in the picture.

## Ingredients

* olive oil
* 1 lb Italian sausage, meatballs, and/or chicken pieces
* 1/2 c. chopped onion
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 large (2 lb 3 oz) can tomatoes
* 2/3 of a small (6 oz) can of tomato paste
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp oregano or to taste

## Directions

Brown the meat in the oil (or continue in the pan from my meatball recipe). Remove the meat and brown the onions in the remaining fat. Add the garlic. Return the meat to the pan. Add tomatoes. If you drained whole tomatoes, make up for the liquid with 1/2 c. water. Mix in the tomato paste. Add seasonings. Cook for at least one hour.
