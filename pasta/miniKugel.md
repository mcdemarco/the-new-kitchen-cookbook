# Mini Noodle Kugel

I'm not such a fan of noodle kugel that I'd boil a whole package of noodles for it, but I had about a third of a package left over from something else and noodle kugel seemed like the ideal use for it.

Serves 1--2.

## Ingredients

* 4 oz. (dry) egg noodles or pasta, cooked
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 1 T. butter, melted if necessary
* 4 oz. sour cream or yogurt (preferably full-fat Greek yogurt)
* 2 oz. cottage cheese or cream cheese
* 1/4 c. milk
* 3 T. sugar
* 1/4 tsp. vanilla
* 1/4 tsp. pumpkin spice 
* pinch of salt

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â° with convection.
2. Grease a small loaf pan.
3. If the noodles are particularly stuck, warm them up in hot water and drain again.  Toss with the butter (instead of melting it).
4. Mix other ingredients.  Use a stand mixer with whisk attachment if you're using cream cheese or other thick ingredients.
5. Bake 30 minutes, until lightly browned.  Cover if necessary.

Serve at any temperature.

## Variants

You can use any dessert-type spice, or no spice, in place of the [pumpkin spice mix](../appetizers/pumpkinSpice.md).

You can top with a crumble of cookies and sugar like [Tori Avery would](https://toriavey.com/vanilla-noodle-kugel/).

You can brown the butter like [The Kitchn would](https://www.thekitchn.com/noodle-kugel-recipe-23421017).

Raisins are always an option.

There are a lot of variations on the cheese/cream/milk mix.  One of the more interesting is [Ina Garten's](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/noodle-kugel-recipe-1920887) ricotta and half-and-half, not to mention Tori Avery's pudding.
