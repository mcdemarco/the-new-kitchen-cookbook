# Fake Bolognese Sauce

I've never been a fan of Bolognese sauce (ground beef belongs in meatballs) but Peter likes it so we threw some together. It turned out to be easy and pretty yummy.

## Ingredients

* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3--5 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 lb ground beef
* 2 cubes frozen basil (2 tsp.)
* red pepper flakes to taste
* 1 jar mild commercial sauce (or equivalent amount of canned tomato sauce)

## Directions

1. Fry onions in olive oil in a cast iron pan.
2. Add garlic.
3. Add ground beef and brown.
4. Drain off some fat, if you're that sort of person.
5. Add basil and red pepper.
6. Add sauce and heat through.
7. Serve over pasta.
