# Arugula Pesto

Peter likes arugula but not salad that's just greens, so sometimes some leftover arugula needs using up.  I made some into pesto because I had a lot of walnuts around as well, and then I put it on some otherwise plain Israeli couscous.  The process is almost the same as for [basil pesto](../pasta/pesto.md)

This particular recipe is based on [Elise Bauer's](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/arugula_pesto/), though I'm not sure it's significantly different from all the others out there.

## Ingredients

* 2 c. packed arugula
* 1/2 c. chopped walnuts
* 6 cloves garlic, unpeeled
* 1/2 tsp. kosher salt
* up to 1/2 c. olive oil
* up to 1/2 c. grated parmesan

## Directions

1. Toast the garlic and nuts in a dry pan for 10 minutes (garlic) and/or until toasted.
2. Peel and chop the garlic.
3. Combine all non-cheese ingredients in a food processor.
4. Mix in cheese manually.

## Variants

You can use a mortar and pestle instead of a food processor.

For an easier sauce, you can chop the arugula just a bit and wilt it.  Add red and black pepper, and optionally vinegar.
