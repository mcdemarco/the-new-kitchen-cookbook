# Alfredo Sauce

I happened to have enough cream around to try [the Recipe Critic's alfredo sauce recipe](https://therecipecritic.com/the-best-homemade-alfredo-sauce-ever/), but it could easily be cut in half.  I mainly changed the cheese to a mix, using a weird South American cheese for the second hard cheese and adding the soft cheese I had at hand.

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

* 12 oz. to 1 lb. pasta, traditionally fettuccini
* 2 c. (1 pint) heavy cream (whipping or otherwise)
* 1/2 c. (1 stick) butter
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* dash garlic powder to taste
* 1/4 tsp. ground pepper
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* dash nutmeg
* 1/2 c. grated parmesan
* 1/4 c. grated other hard cheese
* 2 oz. shredded mozzarella

## Directions

1. Boil pasta with a generous amount of salt according to package directions.
2. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan and fry the garlic in it briefly.
3. Add all spices.
4. Add cream.  Optionally, heat through.
5. Add all cheeses.
5. Simmer about 5 minutes to desired thickness.
6. Freshen pasta and mix with the sauce and optionally some pasta water in a large bowl (or in the sauce pan, if it's large enough and you're not setting some sauce aside).
7. Serve hot.

## Variants

Most recipes of this sort (including the source recipe) use one cup parmesan, or half parmesan and half romano.  Some use even more cheese.

Add the typical Italian seasonings.

Cook 2--3 diced zucchini separately and add for variety.

Add a 14 oz. can of salmon (or a couple of fillets, cooked and chopped, or even some smoked salmon) and/or 2 c. peas, if you like that sort of thing.
