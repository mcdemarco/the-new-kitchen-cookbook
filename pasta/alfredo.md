# Alfredo Sauce

I happened to have enough cream around to try [the Recipe Critic's alfredo sauce recipe](https://therecipecritic.com/the-best-homemade-alfredo-sauce-ever/), but it could easily be cut in half.  I mainly changed the cheese to a mix, using a weird South American cheese for the second hard cheese and adding the soft cheese I had at hand.

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

* 2 c. heavy cream (whipping or otherwise)
* 1/2 c. (1 stick) butter
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* dash garlic powder to taste
* 1/4 tsp. ground pepper
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* dash nutmeg
* 1/2 c. grated parmesan
* 1/4 c. grated other hard cheese
* 2 oz. shredded mozzarella

## Directions

1. Boil pasta (about 1 lb.) with a generous amount of salt.
2. Melt butter in a heavy saucepan and fry the garlic in it briefly.
3. Add all spices.
4. Add cream and all cheeses.
5. Heat through, then simmer about 5 minutes to desired thickness.
6. Freshen pasta and mix with the sauce and optionally some pasta water in a large bowl (or in the sauce pan, if it's large enough and you're not setting some sauce aside).
7. Serve hot.

## Variants

Most recipes of this sort (including the source recipe) use one cup parmesan, or half parmesan and half romano.

You can add a 14 oz. can of salmon (or a couple of fillets, cooked and chopped, or even some smoked salmon) and/or 2 c. peas, if you like that sort of thing.
