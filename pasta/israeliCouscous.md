# Israeli Couscous

I cut down [this Israeli couscous stuffing](https://littlespicejar.com/stuffed-butternut-squash-curried-couscous-salad/) from The Little Spice Jar for use in [stuffing squash](../roots/stuffedSquash.md), and then added instant pot directions [from The Foreign Fork](https://foreignfork.com/cous-cous-recipe/) for use in absorbing extra chicken liquid when making chicken in the instant pot.

Israeli couscous is the round pearled one, not the fine Moroccan version.  It is a pasta, but it is not real couscous.  (For real couscous, just follow the package directions.)

Serves 2--4.

## Ingredients 

### 2--3 Servings

* 2 tsp. olive oil
* 2/3 c. Israeli couscous
* 1 c. water or broth
* chopped garlic and/or onions to taste

### 4 Servings

* 1 T. olive oil
* 1 c. Israeli couscous
* 1 1/2 c. water or broth
* chopped garlic and/or onions to taste


## Directions

1. Optionally, toast (saut√©) the couscous in oil with optional onions until the couscous browns somewhat, adding optional garlic at the end.
2. Carefully add liquid.
3. Cook under pressure for 7 minutes, wait 2 minutes, and release, or simmer on the stovetop 10 minutes.  You can continue to cook until liquid is absorbed and/or the couscous reaches the desired tenderness.
4. Fluff couscous.

## Variants

Toasting Israeli couscous is optional, but it does look nicer that way.

When using leftover juice from previous Instant Pot cooking, pour carefully into a Pyrex measuring cup and add hot water to reach the specified amount of broth.
