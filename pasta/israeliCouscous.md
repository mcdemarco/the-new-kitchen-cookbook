# Israeli Couscous

I cut down [this Israeli couscous stuffing](https://littlespicejar.com/stuffed-butternut-squash-curried-couscous-salad/) from The Little Spice Jar for use in [stuffing squash](../roots/stuffedSquash.md), and then added instant pot directions [from The Foreign Fork](https://foreignfork.com/cous-cous-recipe/) for use in absorbing extra chicken liquid when making chicken in the instant pot.

Israeli couscous is the round pearled one, not the fine Moroccan version.  It is a pasta, but it is not real couscous.  (For real couscous, just follow the package directions.)

Serves 2--4.

## Ingredients 

* 1 T. olive oil
* 1 c. Israeli couscous
* 1 1/2 c. water or broth
* chopped garlic and/or onions to taste


## Directions

1. Optionally, toast (sauté) the couscous in oil with optional onions until the couscous browns somewhat, adding optional garlic at the end.
2. Carefully add liquid.
3. Cook under pressure for 5 minutes, with medium release, or simmer on the stovetop 10 minutes.  You can continue to cook until liquid is absorbed and/or the couscous reaches the desired tenderness.
4. Fluff couscous.

## Variants

Toasting Israeli couscous is optional, but it does look nicer that way.

When using leftover juice from previous Instant Pot cooking, pour carefully into a Pyrex measuring cup and add hot water to reach the specified amount of broth.  You may want to toast the couscous on the stove in that case because the instant pot's sauté functionality is even sketchier after pressure cooking, or just to save time.
