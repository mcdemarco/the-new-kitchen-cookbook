# Salmon Casserole

This was our second try after a failed impromptu salmon casserole.  Inspiration came from the fridge, this [simple roux recipe](http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/salmon-casserole-183699) (after doubling the sauce as recommended), this [Chowhound thread](https://www.chowhound.com/post/canned-salmon-salmon-patties-827419?commentId=7068504), this [salad with capers](http://ifoodreal.com/canned-salmon-salad-recipe/), and my mac and cheese recipe.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 lb. macaroni
* 14 1/2 oz. can salmon, broken up
* 2--3 c. shredded cheese
* 1 c. frozen peas, warmed
* 2--3 oz. capers
* bread crumbs (optional)

### Sauce

* 4 T. butter
* 2 c. milk
* 1/2 c. minced onion
* 2 T. flour
* 1/2 tsp. mustard powder (optional)
* dash cayenne pepper (optional)
* dash cumin powder (optional)
* 2 T. lemon juice or mirin
* 2 tsp. parsley

## Directions

1. Boil pasta with a generous amount of salt and drain.
2. Preheat oven to 375Â°.
3. Mix flour and spices (except parsley).
4. Fry onions in butter.  Gradually add flour mixture.
5. Slowly stir in milk and thicken.
4. Add lemon juice, parsley, and at least half the cheese.
5. Mix in remaining ingredients except cheese (salmon, pasta, capers).
6. Load into sprayed casserole.
7. Top with remaining cheese, optionally mixed with bread crumbs.
8. Bake 25 minutes or until browned.

## Variants

Monterey Jack was the specified cheese, but I used a mix of cheddar and mozzarella I had hanging around.

The original was also more layered than mixed.
