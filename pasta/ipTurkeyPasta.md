# Instant Pot Pasta with Ground Turkey

I wasn't sure I believed the Instant Pot could make pasta, but I tried [this one pot recipe](https://www.lifeisbutadish.com/easy-instant-pot-pasta/) from Life is But a Dish and it worked out fine.

## Ingredients

* olive oil
* 1 lb. ground turkey
* 1 chopped onion
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp savory
* pepper to taste
* 2 T. tomato paste
* 2 c. water
* 2 c. tomato sauce 
* 12 oz. short pasta
* green leafy vegetables or similar vegetables (optional)

## Directions

1. Turn on saute and brown the onions in the oil as usual.
2. Add the garlic for one minute.
3. Add the ground turkey, break up, and brown.
4. Mix the spices separately and sprinkle on the turkey.
5. Mix in the tomato paste.
6. Turn off Saute.
7. Mix in water and pasta.
8. Pour sauce on top but do not mix in.
9. Optionally, top with a vegetable that will cook in about 5 minutes.
10. Close vent and lid.
11. Pressure cook on high for half the time listed on the pasta box.  Turn off keep warm.
12. Quick release.

## Variants

Green beans worked well as a vegetable.

Ground beef or other ground meats should work the same.  Adjust the spices to taste.  For a beef at a different size, see [Instant Pot Pasta with Ground Beef](../ipBeefPasta.md).
