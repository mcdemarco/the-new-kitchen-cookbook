# Instant Pot Pasta with Ground Beef

I wasn't sure I believed the Instant Pot could make pasta, but I succeeded with [Instant Pot Pasta with Ground Turkey](../ipTurkeyPasta.md).  
I get beef in different quantities so I adjusted the recipe for that and spice, below (and for the flavor of cooking the pasta in the sauce).

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

* olive oil
* 3/4 lb. ground beef
* 1 chopped onion
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp basil
* 1/2 tsp oregano
* 1/2 tsp marjoram
* pepper to taste
* red pepper flakes to taste
* 2 T. tomato paste
* 1 1/2 c. water or broth
* 1 1/2 c. tomato sauce
* 9 oz. short pasta
* green leafy vegetables or similar vegetables (optional)

## Directions

1. Turn on saute and brown the onions in the oil as usual.
2. Add the garlic for one minute.
3. Add the ground beef, break up, and brown.
4. Mix the spices separately and sprinkle on the beef.
5. Mix in the tomato paste.
6. Turn off Saute.
7. Mix in water and pasta.
8. Pour sauce on top but do not mix in.
9. Optionally, top with a vegetable that will cook in about 5 minutes.
10. Close vent and lid.
11. Pressure cook on high for half the time listed on the pasta box.  Turn off keep warm.
12. Quick release.

## Variants

You can use raw tomato sauce or prepackaged marinara.  If going raw, you may want to up the spices.

Green beans worked well as a vegetable.

This recipe is a variant in size and meat of my [Instant Pot Pasta with Ground Turkey](../ipTurkeyPasta.md).

Instant pot [bolognese](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-spaghetti-bolognese/) or [American goulash](https://spicecravings.com/instant-pot-goulash-recipe) are similar adaptations of the [stovetop](../pasta/bolognese.md) [recipes](../pasta/chopsuey.md).
