# Pesto

I found a pesto recipe with weights in [this Chowhound thread](https://www.chowhound.com/post/basil-pesto-bulk-548056?commentId=3964309).

## Ingredients

* 3 oz. / 75 g. fresh basil (weighed with some stem)
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 T. pine nuts, optionally toasted
* up to 1 T. coarse salt
* 2 oz. grated parmesan
* up to 1/4 c. olive oil

## Directions

1. Boil pasta with a generous amount of salt and drain.
2. In a food processor, chop basil with garlic, pine nuts, and the oil.
3. Mix in parmesan manually.
4. Freshen pasta and mix with the sauce and optionally some pasta water in a large bowl (or in the sauce pan, if it's large enough).
5. Serve hot or cold.
