# Squash Bolognese Sauce

I made this with a butternut squash Peter brought home, but any winter squash should do.  It was inspired by [butternut squash beefaroni](https://thehealthyfoodie.com/butternut-squash-beefaroni/), the least dairy butternut and ground beef pasta recipe I could find at the time.

Serves: 6

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. dry pasta
* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 1/2 lb. ground beef
* 1 small jar marinara sauce (or equivalent amount of canned chopped tomatoes)
* 1 small winter squash
* 1 tsp. oregano
* 1 tsp. paprika
* basil to taste
* marjoram to taste
* sage to taste
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. ground pepper

## Directions

1. Cook squash in the oven or Instant Pot.
2. Cook pasta according to package directions.
2. Fry onions in olive oil in a cast iron pan.
3. Add garlic; fry briefly.
4. Add ground beef and spices; brown the beef.
5. Drain off some fat, if you're that sort of person.
6. Add sauce and heat through.
7. Serve over pasta.
