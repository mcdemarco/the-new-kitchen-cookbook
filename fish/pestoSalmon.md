# Pesto Salmon

I got this idea from some leftover pesto and a slight misunderstanding of [pampered chef's recipe](https://www.pamperedchef.com/recipe/Main+Dishes/Under+30+minutes/Baked+Pesto+Salmon/50154).

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

* 2 6oz. salmon filets
* 2 T. pesto
* olive oil as needed
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* 1 tsp. lemon juice
* lemon zest (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* dash pepper (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F.
2. Mix non-spice ingredients well, adding sufficient olive oil to get a consistency that will stick to the salmon.
3. Place salmon skin side down (if there's skin) in a lighly oiled baking dish, and spread pesto mix on top.
4. Sprinkle with spices.
5. Bake 12--16 minutes depending on thickness and doneness.

## Variants

Bake with vegetables, such as onion, mushrooms, and/or summer squash.  (Some of the listed ingredients were originally intended for coating vegetables, but I misunderstood the recipe at the time.)
