# One Instant Pot Salmon

This procedure is mostly as suggested by [Tasty Oven](https://tastyoven.com/instant-pot-salmon-and-rice/), which differed from many other frozen salmon and rice [Instant Pot] recipes in including vegetables and cooking the food with the sauce.  

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

* 2 or 3 6oz. frozen salmon filets
* 1 1/4 c. white basmati rice
* 1 1/2 c. water
* a handful of green beans
* 4 cloves garlic, crushed
* 2 tsp. sesame oil or to taste
* 1/4 c. maple syrup
* 1/4 c. rice wine vinegar
* 2 T. soy sauce
* 1 tsp. lime juice
* 1/2 tsp. sriracha (optional)
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* black pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Place rice and water in instant pot.
2. Add trivet and place salmon filets on it.
3. Add vegetables in between and/or around the edges.
4. Mix remaining ingredients and pour over the salmon.
5. Close pot and vent.  Cook on high pressure for 4 minutes.
6. Turn off keep warm.
6. Turn off keep warm.
6. Turn off keep warm some more.
7. Release steam naturally for 5 minutes, then vent artificially and serve.

## Variants

You can substitute other somewhat durable vegetables, even frozen ones that cook quickly.
The quantity of vegetables should be what you prefer to serve to two people.

You can up the recipe to 3 people with more rice and up to 4 filets; after that the pot will probably get too crowded.

The original recipe used a cake pan on the trivet for the fish and vegetables.
