# Baked Trout

We got some whole dressed trout from Market Basket after a long day, so I adapted [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/236814/baked-fresh-rainbow-trout/) because it seemed quick and easy.

## Ingredients

* 2 whole dressed trout (about 1 1/2 lbs)
* olive oil
* 1/2 onion, sliced
* 1/4 tsp. dill
* 1/4 tsp. thyme
* dash powdered safflower (a Portuguese spice)
* salt to taste
* 2 lemon slices (optional)
* pepper to taste
* Essence of Emeril (optional), to taste (see my [Spicy Asian Chicken](../poultry/asianChicken.md) recipe for details)
* 2 T. water or lemon juice

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F convection (400°F otherwise).
2. Oil fish and a non-glass casserole.
3. Coat fish inside and out with all spices except the pepper, and stuff with onion slices.
4. Sprinkle pepper on top and place optional lemon slices on top of that.
5. Bake 10 minutes.
6. Add water and bake 10 more minutes or until flaky.
