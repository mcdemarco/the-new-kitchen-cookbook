# Maple Broiled Salmon

I saw this recipe on TV at my mother-in-law's and found an indirect link, [Jacques Pépin’s Broiled Salmon with Miso Glaze – for Two](http://inthekitchenwithkath.com/2015/10/28/jacques-pepins-broiled-salmon-with-miso-glaze-for-two/) to a cut-down version online.  I wasn't overwhelmed by the outcome but Peter liked it well enough.  I think it could stand to be spicier; the sriracha was drowned in the sweetness of the maple syrup.

As mentioned on TV, I substituted white miso for red miso because I had it.  As mentioned on the internet, the chef's suggested four minutes of broiling was much too little; even 8 minutes of broiling left them a bit underdone---which wasn't bad, but you should trust your salmon if you're going to eat it that way.

Serves 2.
