# Panko-Crusted Salmon

This is another recipe for Costco's big bags of frozen salmon.  It was formerly a footnote to my Costco Salmon recipe, but Peter likes it so it's been promoted to a real recipe.  I found [the original recipe](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2014/10/panko-crusted-honey-mustard-salmon/) on Pinterest, but simplified and reduced it for my purposes.

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

* 2 salmon steaks, defrosted (about 1 1/2 lbs.)

### Coating

* 1 T honey
* 1 T mustard (or 1 tsp dry mustard powder)
* 1-2 crushed garlic cloves
* a dash of lemon juice

### Panko Mix

* 1/3 c. panko
* 1 T chopped parsley
* 2 tsp. olive oil
* salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Mix the coating and panko ingredients separately.
2. Spread the coating on both sides of the salmon steaks.
3. Dip one side of each steak in panko mix, and put it panko side down into baking dish.
3. Sprinkle the remaining panko on top.
4. Bake 12-15 minutes (depending on thickness) in a 400° oven.
5. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.


## Variants

For [panko-crusted trout](http://www.todaysparent.com/recipe/fish/crispy-oven-baked-trout-recipe/), replace the honey with oil or mayo, reduce the mustard to 2 tsp (or optionally substitute 1/2 tsp. wasabi powder), and skip all panko ingredients except panko with 3 T. grated parmesan.  Sprinkle the panko on the non-skin side of the trout instead of dredging in it.  Bake 12 minutes at 425° or convect at 400°.
