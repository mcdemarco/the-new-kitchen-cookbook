# Panko-Crusted Salmon

This is another recipe for Costco's big bags of frozen salmon.  It was formerly a footnote to my Costco Salmon recipe, but Peter likes it so it's been promoted to a real recipe.  I found [the original recipe](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2014/10/panko-crusted-honey-mustard-salmon/) on Pinterest, but simplified and reduced for my purposes.

Serves 2.

## Ingredients

* 2 salmon steaks, defrosted

* 1 T honey
* 1 T mustard (or 1 tsp dry mustard powder)
* 1-2 crushed garlic cloves
* a dash of lemon juice

* 1/3 c. panko
* 1 T chopped parsley
* 2 tsp. olive oil
* salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Mix the first four and second four ingredients separately.
2. Spread the mustard mix on both sides of the salmon steaks.
3. Dip one side of each steak in panko, and put it panko side down into baking dish.
3. Sprinkle the remaining panko on top.
4. Bake 12-15 minutes (depending on thickness) in a 400Â° oven.
5. Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
