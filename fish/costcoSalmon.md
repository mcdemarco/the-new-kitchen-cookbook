# Costco Salmon

Costco has big bags of single portions of frozen boneless, skinless salmon.  The instructions on the back say to defrost in running cold water for 20 minutes, but I defrost in still cold water for 30 minutes. 

I coat the salmon in a bit of olive oil and sprinkle with salt, dill, thyme, and tarragon.  The instructions say to cook 15-20 minutes at 350Â°, but I find that even 15 minutes is usually too much.  I haven't determined the correct cooking time, though.
