# Costco Salmon

Costco has big bags of single portions of frozen boneless, skinless salmon.  The instructions on the back say to defrost in running cold water for 20 minutes, but I defrost in still cold water for 30 minutes. 

## Directions

I coat the salmon in a bit of olive oil and sprinkle with salt, dill, thyme, and tarragon.  The instructions say to cook 15-20 minutes at 350°, but I find that even 15 minutes is usually too much.  I haven't determined the correct cooking time, though.

## Variants

I tried [a recipe for panko-crusted salmon](http://www.cookingclassy.com/2014/10/panko-crusted-honey-mustard-salmon/) that I found on Pinterest, but I found that it was more work than reward.  In brief (as simplified and reduced for my purposes):  mix 1 T honey, 1 T mustard, 1 crushed garlic clove, and a dash of lemon juice together.  Also mix 1/3 c. panko, 1 T chopped parsley, 1 T olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste.  Spread the mustard mix on both sides of 2 pieces of salmon, then dip one side in half the panko and put them panko-down into a baking dish.  Sprinkle the remaining panko on top.  Bake 12 minutes in a 400° oven.  Let stand 5 minutes before serving.
