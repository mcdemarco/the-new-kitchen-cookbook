# Costco Salmon

Costco has big bags of single portions of frozen boneless, skinless salmon.  The instructions on the back say to defrost in running cold water for 20 minutes, but I defrost in still cold water for 30 minutes. 

## Ingredients

* 2--3 portions salmon, defrosted
* olive oil
* salt
* dill
* thyme
* tarragon

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350°.
2. Coat the salmon in a bit of olive oil.
3. Sprinkle with salt and herbs.
4. Cook up to 15 minutes.

## Variants

See my recipe for [Panko-Crusted Salmon](../fish/pankoSalmon.md), [Spicy Salmon](../fish/spicySalmon.md), or [Pesto Salmon](../fish/pestoSalmon.md).

[Kara Lydon recommends](https://karalydon.com/recipes/the-best-way-to-cook-salmon-slow-cooked-salmon/) baking salmon for 20--25 minutes at 300°.
