# Fried Smelt

I found a recipe I liked for fried smelt, but I misplaced it.  Fortunately, they're all pretty similar, except that I add more spice.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 lbs fresh or frozen dressed smelt
* 1 egg
* 1/2 c. soy milk (optional)
* 1/2 c. flour
* 2 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. black pepper
* 1/2 tsp. turmeric or a dash powdered safflower
* dash garlic powder
* dash mustard powder
* dash ground ginger
* 1 scotch bonnet (or dried red pepper flakes to taste)
* 2 scallions
* sesame oil
* white wine

## Directions

Mix liquid ingredients.  Mix flour and spices.  Chop scallions and dice pepper.  Rinse smelt and pat dry.

Dip smelt in liquid ingredients, then dredge in flour mixture.  Fry in batches with oil, peppers, and white parts of the scallion until golden (about 3 minutes per side).

Remove smelt and deglaze the pan with the white wine and green parts of the scallions.  Pour over smelt.
