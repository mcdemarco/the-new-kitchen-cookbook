# Bacalhau com Broa

It's not easy to find a salt cod recipe without potatoes.  I couldn't find this particular well-known one in my Portuguese cookbooks, so I translated it from [this recipe and video](http://www.soparamulheres.pt/a-verdadeira-receita-de-bacalhau-com-broa-e-de-comer-e-chorar-por-mais/) instead.  I rearranged it a bit.  Note that broa (a.k.a. broa de milho) is a leavened cornbread with some grain flour in it.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 lb. salted cod (weight after soaking one day)
* 1 onion, sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, sliced
* 1/2 c. (about 3 oz.) oil cured olives, or to taste (optional)
* 1 lb crumbled broa or corn bread (or enough to cover the baking dish)
* oil to moisten the corn bread 
* salt and pepper to taste
* chopped cilantro to taste

## Directions

1. After soaking, put the cod in a pot, cover with water, and bring to a boil.
2. Simmer for about 15 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, fry the onions in another pan (preferably a flat-bottomed one that can go from the stove to the oven and fits the fish in one layer), allegedly for 15 minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 350Â°.
5. Fish the fish out of the water.  This is a good time to de-bone it if it has bones or fins.
5. Add the fish, garlic, some of the cilantro, and any olives to the onion pan.
6. Fry the fish another ten minutes or so.
6. Make a paste of the crumbs, remaining spices, and oil.
7. Arrange the fish in the (baking) pan, skin down if it has skin, and cover with the paste.
8. Bake 20 minutes or until the crumbs are nicely browned.

## Variants

I actually used corn meal with some egg, almond milk, and baking powder to form a crust, but I'd do it the right way next time.

The olives are also my variant from the recipe cited.
