# Baked Mackerel

![baked mackerel](../images/baked_mackerel.jpg)

We got some frozen whole mackerel from Market Basket, but cleaning them was too much work for Peter.

## Ingredients

* 1 3/4 lbs bag frozen whole mackerel
* salt
* garlic powder
* paprika
* powdered safflower (a Portuguese spice)
* thyme or mustard powder

## Directions

Clean mackerel. Oil fillets and spice flesh side. Place on parchment paper (on baking sheet) skin side up. Bake 10-12 minutes at 400Â°.

## Variants

I tried [a different whole mackerel recipe](http://www.themediterraneandish.com/oven-roasted-spanish-mackerel/) on some dressed mackerel.  I didn't slice them into chunks; I just folded them around the ingredients.
