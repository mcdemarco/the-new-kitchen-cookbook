# Salmon Steaks

This recipe was inspired by an oversized 1.5 lb. salmon steak, which I cut in half down the spine line in order to put the skin side down.  Quantities are approximate.  It served two.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 lb. salmon
* 1 T olive oil
* 1 T honey
* 1/2 T soy sauce
* 1/2 T lemon juice
* 1 tsp wasabi powder
* 1 tsp powdered ginger
* generous dash hungarian paprika
* dash dill

## Directions

1. Preheat convection oven to 375Â°F.
2. Cut the salmon steak(s) into the intended serving sizes.
2. Mix remaining ingredients except dill in a baking dish.
3. Rub all sides of salmon in the mixture, then arrange skin side down (if practical) in the baking dish.
4. Sprinkle with dill.  Marinate as time allows.
5. Bake 15-20 minutes, depending on thickness.

## Variants

If you don't have wasabi powder, powdered or fresh mustard will do.
