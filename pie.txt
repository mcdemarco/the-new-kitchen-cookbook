# Pie!

Yes, pie is its own chapter.

## Crust

First, the crust.  My crusts all started from the basic  piecrust recipe in my old Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook (which my sister said to use), but have been adjusted so I don't have to keep doing the math.  

I usually make a 9" pie with the 9" recipe, but if you're bad at rolling out dough (or you want leftovers), you should up it to the 10" recipe.

### Ingredients 

#### Single-crust pie shell

(This is half of the 10" double-crust pie recipe.)

* 1 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 2 1/2 - 3 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (8")

* 1 1/2 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 1/2 c. butter-flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 3 to 4 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (9")

(This should do for a 9" pie.)

* 1 3/4 c. flour 
* 1/2 c. + 1 T. + 1 tsp. butter flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 4-5 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (10")

* 2 c. flour 
* 1 tsp salt 
* 2/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 5-6 T. cold water

### Directions (All Crusts)

Mix flour & salt. Cut in shortening with a pastry cutter. When pieces are pea-sized, add water gradually until just damp. Squeeze into a ball.  For a double crust, divide in half.  Chill for about an hour. 

Roll out bottom crust between parchment paper and plastic wrap.  (If making a double crust, use the larger half for the bottom crust.)  Peel off the parchment first (or don't, if using only parchment) and flip into pie plate.  Adjust carefully if necessary, then peel off the plastic wrap.  Fill with desired filling.

For a top crust, roll out the remaining dough.  Prep the seam by rubbing shortening on the top edge of the bottom crust.  Peel off one sheet and center the top over the pie, then peel the other sheet off carefully and trim and/or roll overlap under as desired.  

Pinch edge of crust to seal/decorate as desired.  (I do the fork thing.)  Cut vents into top crust.  Bake as directed.

## Pies

### Apple Pie

This started out as the Apple Pie recipe from the Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book (revised edition, 1951, ch. 15, p. 11). I reduced the water in the pastry dough, and Peter removed some filling ingredients he didn't approve of. Unfortunately, he didn't mention that the pie would need more time in the oven for the no-apple-gravy approach, so my first attempt came out a bit soggy. (Cooking times have been adjusted.)

#### Ingredients

* 1 8" or 9" double-crust pie shell (uncooked)
* 6 Cortland apples 
* 3/4 c. sugar 
* 2 tsp. Vietnamese cinnamon 
* 1/4 tsp. nutmeg

#### Directions

Slice apples thin. Toss with remaining ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 F.  Fill bottom pie crust with apples, top, and seal. Cut vents into top crust.  Optionally, sprinkle with cinnamon. Bake 10 minutes at 450. Bake 45-50 more minutes at 350. Cool.

### Blueberry Pie

This is a mix of the Better Homes and Gardens Blueberry Pie recipe and the Joy of Cooking Berry or Cherry Pie with Frozen Fruit recipe.

#### Ingredients

* 1 9" double-crust pie shell (uncooked)
* 20 oz. frozen blueberries
* 1 scant c. sugar
* 1/4 c. flour
* 1/8 tsp. salt
* 1 T. lemon juice
* 2 T. butter or butter flavored Crisco

#### Directions

Defrost blueberries.  Make and chill crust.  
Mix non-crust ingredients.  Preheat oven to 450 F.  Roll out and fill crust.  Bake 10 minutes at 450, then bake 35-40 more minutes at 350. Cool.

### Pear Pie

I make pear pie with somewhat underripe pears from our backyard pear tree.  This recipe is from Tennis Maynard via my friend Tom Franczak.  I added the clove, and I'm usually too lazy for the egg white.

#### Ingredients

* 1 9" double-crust pie shell (uncooked)
* about 6 cups peeled, cored and sliced pears 
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg 
* 1.5 tsp ground ginger 
* 1 tsp vanilla (I use vanilla bean paste)
* dash ground clove
* 4 TBS flour
* 1 egg white for crust (optional)

#### Directions

Mix thoroughly, then pour into pie crust and proceed as normally. You do brush your crust with a partially beaten egg white, don't you? Browns nicely. Also of course the usual 3-4 slits for steam. Bake at 425 degrees 10-15 minutes, then turn down to 350 degrees and bake another 30-35 minutes until done. Of course cool before cutting. I always put in enough fruit to make a 'dome' under the crust. Cooks down a little, makes a better pie.

### Pecan Pie

Peter likes lots of pecans in his pie, so I found a simple recipe with more pecans than most.  This one is from [Martha Stewart](http://www.marthastewart.com/312503/pecan-pie).

#### Ingredients

* 1 9" single-crust pie shell (uncooked)
* 4 large eggs 
* 1 cup light corn syrup 
* 1/3 cup packed light-brown sugar 
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 3 cups pecan halves 
* Lightly sweetened whipped cream, for serving (optional)

#### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. with rack set in lowest position. 
2. Using kitchen shears or a paring knife, trim dough to a 1-inch overhang. With floured fingers, fold overhang under itself to form a rim; pinch between thumb and forefinger to form a uniform edge around rim of pie plate. Crimp with fingertips. Transfer dough-lined pie plate to refrigerator. 
3. Make filling: In a large bowl, whisk eggs, corn syrup, sugars, butter, vanilla, and salt until smooth; mix in pecans. Pour mixture into chilled pie crust; place pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until filling jiggles slightly in the center when gently shaken, 50 to 60 minutes. 
4. Cool pie completely in plate, 5 to 6 hours. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.
