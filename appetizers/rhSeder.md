# Rosh Hashanah Seder

Like the better-known [seder](../appetizers/seder.md), the main difficultly in putting together the Rosh Hashanah seder is finding and remembering everything.  Fortunately, there are plenty of substitutions, and most Ashkenazim will settle for just apples and honey.  For the order of operations and blessings, see [A Family Seder for Rosh Hashanah](http://lisabaydush.com/Music%20Units/Rosh%20Hashanah/Rosh%20Hashanah%20seder.pdf) or various similar documents online.

## Ingredients

## A Rosh Hashanah Menu

Here are some menu ideas mixed together from various years.  Often my choice of dishes is intended to use up the excess seder ingredients.

0. All of the previously mentioned items
1. [Pasta Fagioli](../soup/fazool.md) with the black-eyed peas, [moqueca](https://twosleevers.com/brazilian-moqueca/), [spicy pumpkin soup](../soup/spicyPumpkin.md) (the leek variant), [Italian wedding soup](../soup/italianWedding.md), or another soup chosen to use up seder extras
2. Green salad
3. A seasonal starch of some sort such as [Couscous Stuffed Squash](../roots/stuffedSquash.md), [Carrot and Raisin Basmati Rice](https://jamiegeller.com/recipes/rosh-hashanah-carrot-and-raisin-basmati-rice/), a wild rice pilaf, or [Stuffed peppers](../rice/stuffedPeppers.md)
3. [Tzimmes](../roots/tzimmes.md) (the Rosh Hashanah variant)
4. [Briskette](../meat/briskette.md) or [Crockpot Briskette](../meat/crockpotBriskette.md) (about 1/3 lb. per person, more if you want any leftover), or [Stufadin](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/braised-meat-with-butternut-squash-15414) (_Cucina Ebraica_ p.145)
5. [Non-dairy Pumpkin Pie](../pie/nonDairyPumpkin.md), [Apple pie](../pie/apple.md), [Apple cake](https://www.thespruceeats.com/kosher-apple-cake-2121494), or [honey cake](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/09/majestic-and-moist-honey-cake/)

If possible, make the brisket, dessert, and whatever else you can manage a day ahead.

Warm up anything cooked ahead at the appropriate point of the meal, if necessary.
