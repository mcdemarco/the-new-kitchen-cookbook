# Pão de Queijo Frito (Deep-Fried Brazilian Cheese Bread)

*Pão de queijo* isn't bread, but you can deep-fry it like [fry dough](../bread/fryDough.md).  The internet will tell you how to deep fry [traditional pão de queijo](../appetizers/paoDeQueijo.md); unfortunately [easy pão de queijo](../appetizers/easyPaoDeQueijo.md) dough is too thin for deep frying.

Makes 40, best eaten warm

## Ingredients

* 1 batch of [traditional pão de queijo](../appetizers/paoDeQueijo.md) dough
* oil for frying

## Directions

1. Heat 3" of oil oven to 365°.
2. Mix dough and form balls according to the directions.
3. Lower some balls into the hot oil with a strainer.  Don't overcrowd the oil.
5. Fry until golden on each side, turning once.
6. Remove to a rack.

Serve hot.

## Variants

Portuguese recipes tend not to provide a frying temperature, though I've seen 180°C (355°F) mentioned.  The temperature in this recipe was chosen on general principles.  Just try to keep the oil above 350° and below 375°.
