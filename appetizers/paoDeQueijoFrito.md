# Pão de Queijo Frito (Deep-Fried Brazilian Cheese Bread)

*Pão de queijo* isn't bread, but you can deep-fry it like [fry dough](../bread/fryDough.md).  The internet will tell you how to deep fry [traditional pão de queijo](../appetizers/paoDeQueijo.md), but you can also deep fry [easy pão de queijo](../appetizers/easyPaoDeQueijo.md).

Keep in mind that if you're truly unlucky you can make a [non-Newtonian fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Newtonian_fluid) out of tapioca starch and damage your blender.  To avoid this rare occurrence, be sure to follow the easy pão de queijo instructions carefully (mix all wet ingredients first, then add the dry ingredients gradually).  

Makes 15--40, depending, best eaten warm

## Ingredients

* 1 batch of [traditional pão de queijo](../appetizers/paoDeQueijo.md) or [easy pão de queijo](../appetizers/easyPaoDeQueijo.md) dough
* additional tapioca starch (if going easy)
* oil for frying

## Directions

1. Heat 3" of oil oven to 365°.
2. Mix dough according to the chosen directions.
3. For easy pão de queijo, **carefully** add tapioca starch (of either variety) until the batter is the consistency of honey and will pour slowly.
4. For traditional pão de queijo, just lower the balls into the hot oil with a strainer.  For easy pão de queijo, add batter to the oil using a small trigger scoop.
5. Fry until golden on each side, turning once.
6. Remove to a rack.

Serve hot.

## Variants

Portuguese recipes tend not to provide a frying temperature, though I've seen 180° (355°) mentioned.  The temperature in the recipe was chosen on general principles.  Just try to keep the oil above 350° and below 375°.

I have made the whole thing in a three-cup measuring cup.
