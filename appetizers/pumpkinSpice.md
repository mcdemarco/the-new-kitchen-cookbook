# Pumpkin Spice

For your seasonal needs, a pumpkin spice mix based on my [pumpkin](../pie/pumpkin.md) [pie](../pie/nonDairyPumpkin.md) 
recipes.  Use about 1 tablespoon in a pie.

Pumpkin spice lattes are more than just pie spice in a coffee; see, *e.g.,* [Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte recipe](https://athome.starbucks.com/recipe/pumpkin-spice-latte).

## Ingredients

* 2 T. cinnamon
* 2 tsp. ginger
* 1/2 T. nutmeg 
* 1 tsp. clove
* 1 tsp. allspice
* dash black pepper

## Directions

Mix.

## Variants

Most recipes are much heavier on the cinnamon.  Some are unusually light on nutmeg.

You can replace nutmeg with mace; historically both were used but cinnamon was omitted.
