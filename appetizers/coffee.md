# Coffee

Peter measures coffee grounds by volume and water according to the carafe.  When I make coffee I measure it by weight, but I don't make it often enough to remember what the Internet says to do (for example, at [this calculator](https://coffeelikeapro.com/coffee-to-water-ratio-calculator), which doesn't measure in "coffee" cups but in standard cups).  So here's what appears to be the usual ratio, plus some math worked out for you because clearly you haven't had your coffee yet.

## Ingredients

* 7 grams coffee
* 1/2 c. water

That would be 14 g. per 1 c., or my usual dose, 21 g. per 1 1/2 c.  Back in my heavy-drinking days, I did 28 g. in 2 c.
