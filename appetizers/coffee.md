# Coffee

Peter measures coffee grounds by volume and water according to the carafe.  When I make coffee I measure it by weight, but I don't make it often enough to remember what the Internet says to do (for example, at [this calculator](https://coffeelikeapro.com/coffee-to-water-ratio-calculator), which doesn't measure in "coffee" cups but in standard cups).  I can manage to fill a filter and turn on the coffee machine in an uncaffeinated state, but we also have a French press that I don't use often enough to remember how it works, so step-by-step instructions are included for that.

So here's what appears to be the usual ratio, plus some math worked out for you because clearly you haven't had your coffee yet.

## Ingredients (drip coffee machine)

* 7 grams coffee
* 1/2 c. water

That would be 14 g. per 1 c., or my usual dose, 21 g. per 1 1/2 c.  Back in my heavy-drinking days, I did 28 g. in 2 c.

## Ingredients (French press)

* 10 grams coffee
* 1/2 c. water

That would be 20 g. per 1 c., or my usual dose, 30 g. per 1 1/2 c.  I have never heavily drunk from a French press, but it would be 40 g. for 2 c.

## Directions

Follow the directions that came with the machine.

For a French press:

1. Remove the plunger.
2. Add coffee. (I weigh it in the carafe.) 
3. Add below-boiling water.  (I transfer it from the kettle to a Pyrex measuring cup, which I figure is enough cooling.)
4. Stir, preferably with a non-metal implement.  (The handle of a cheap wooden spoon works in a pinch.) 
5. Reinsert the plunger to the coffee line.  Do not plunge.
6. Wait 3--4 minutes.
7. Plunge and serve.
