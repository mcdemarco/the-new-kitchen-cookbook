# Essence of Emeril

Emeril's spice mix appears in a couple of "my" recipes, and Peter likes to put it into quesadillas and other flat cheese foods.  It has [fallen off the internet](http://web.archive.org/web/20161208051748/http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/alains-sweet-and-spicy-asian-drumsticks-recipe.html) since I first linked it, so here it is for the record.  Besides "Essence" it is allegedly also called "Bayou Blast".

Fills 1 1/2 spice jars.

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 T. paprika
* 2 T. salt
* 2 T. garlic powder
* 1 T. black pepper
* 1 T. onion powder
* 1 T. cayenne pepper
* 1 T. dried oregano
* 1 T. dried thyme

## Directions

1. Mix.
