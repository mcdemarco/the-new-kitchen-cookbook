# Essence of Emeril

Emeril's spice mix appears in a couple of "my" recipes, and Peter likes to put it into quesadillas and other flat cheese foods.  It has [fallen off the internet](http://web.archive.org/web/20161208051748/http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/alains-sweet-and-spicy-asian-drumsticks-recipe.html) since I first linked it, so here it is for the record, cut down to a single spice jar.  Besides "Essence" it is allegedly also called "Bayou Blast".

Makes 1 jar.

## Ingredients

* 4 1/4 tsp. paprika
* 4 tsp. salt
* 4 tsp. garlic powder
* 2 tsp. black pepper
* 2 tsp. onion powder
* 2 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 2 tsp. dried oregano
* 2 tsp. dried thyme

## Directions

Mix.
