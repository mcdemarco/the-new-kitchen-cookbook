# Fenugreek Tea

There are a lot of underspecified recipes for this online, but [wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Fenugreek-Tea) actually specified some cooking times and directions.  I adjusted them to taste.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 c. water
* 1 T fenugreek seed
* 1 tsp fennel seed (optional)
* 1 tsp nigella (optional)
* 2 T dried nettle (optional)
* 1 slice citrus peel (optional)
* 1 tsp honey (optional)

## Directions

1. Bring all ingredients except honey to a boil.
2. Simmer 6--7 minutes.
3. Strain.
4. Serve hot or cold.

## Variants

The link includes a dried tea recipe for mass production.

You can also eat the seeds after straining them out, but they're pretty bitter.
