# Instant Pot Hard Boiled Eggs

Peter was in the middle of determining the perfect stovetop method when I decided I needed eggs for lunches *right away*.  This method is the hardest boil out of the many, many degrees of boiled eggs documented by [Amy & Jacky](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/pressure-cooker-soft-hard-boiled-eggs/); it's also the version for large (vs. extra large) eggs.

Makes any reasonable quantity of eggs

## Ingredients

* large eggs
* 1 c. cold tap water

## Directions

1. Place eggs on trivet in Instant Pot.
2. Add water.

4. Cook on **low** pressure for 12 minutes.
