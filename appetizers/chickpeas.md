# Roasted Chickpeas

The following is [the recipe](http://web.archive.org/web/20210422211134/https://kalynskitchen.com/crispy-roasted-chickpeas-garbanzo-beans/) that I got my [Moroccan Spice Mix](../appetizers/moroccanSpiceMix.md) from.  It sees more action in the veggies chapter of the cookbook.

## Ingredients

* 1 can chickpeas (garbanzo beans)

* 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. Moroccan Spice Mix
* 1/4 tsp. kosher salt to taste 

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
2. Rinse and dry chickpeas.
3. Toss with other ingredients.
