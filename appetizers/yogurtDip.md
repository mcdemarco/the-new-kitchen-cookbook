# Non-Greek Yogurt Dip

Most yogurt dips are made with Greek yogurt, which I usually have around but didn't this time.  What I did have was a fresh batch of my Moroccan spice mix, so I made a dip out of some merely full-fat Indian-style yogurt, inspired by [this recipe](https://www.dinnersanddreams.net/moroccan-spiced-yogurt-dip/).

Makes 1 cup.

## Ingredients

* 1 cup full-fat yogurt
* 1 clove garlic, crushed
* 2 tsp. [ras el hanout](../appetizers/moroccanSpiceMix.md)
* dash salt

## Directions

1. Strain the yogurt over the tub as necessary, then add to a bowl.
2. Add remaining ingredients.
3. Mix.

## Variants

Roast the garlic first for a milder flavor.
