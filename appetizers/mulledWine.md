# Mulled Wine

To mull wine for a large group, I needed a recipe for three liters (one box) of wine.  The internet is a light drinker, with most recipes being for just a bottle of wine.  I adapted mine from a one-bottle recipe at [The Toasty Kitchen](https://thetoastykitchen.com/slow-cooker-mulled-wine/) (because Peter requested triple sec), an appropriately-sized recipe from [A Good Dish](http://www.agooddish.com/?p=1449), plus a recipe for [gl√ºewein](https://foodcombo.com/recipe/117834/gluhwein-mulled-wine).

Ingredients are also listed for one bottle (750 ml).

## Ingredients

### One Box of Wine

Serves 24.

* 1 box (3 liters) of a cheap cabernet sauvingon
* 4--8 oz. (1/2 -- 1 c.) triple sec, Cointreau, brandy, or Port
* 1 c. apple cider (or juice)
* 1/2 c. maple syrup (or honey)
* 6 cinnamon sticks
* 12 whole cloves
* 3 star anise
* 8 whole allspice
* 8 cardamom pods
* at least 3 slices fresh ginger
* 2 oranges or limes, sectioned (with peel)

### One Bottle of Wine

Serves 6.

* 1 bottle (750 ml) of a cheap cabernet sauvingon
* 1--2 oz. (1/8 -- 1/4 c.) triple sec, Cointreau, brandy, or Port
* 1 c. apple cider (or juice)
* 2 T. maple syrup (or honey)
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 2 whole cloves
* 1 star anise
* 2 whole allspice
* 1 cardamom pods
* sliced fresh ginger to taste
* 1 orange or lime, sectioned (with peel)

## Directions

1. Simmer most ingredients one hour (bottle) or longer (boxes) in a crockpot, or 15 minutes (bottle) or until heated through on medium heat on a stovetop, being careful not to boil.
2. Add triple sec (or other liqueur) just before serving.  (Or let guests add it to taste.)
3. Preferably, serve through a strainer.
4. After the first round, remove any citrus.
5. Hold on low or warm (crockpot), or over a low flame.

## Variants

Some people use zinfandel, tempranillo, burgundy, shiraz, a red blend, and/or moderately good wines.  Nothing truly stunning, though.

Zest & squeeze one of the oranges.

Use apple or orange juice for the non-alcohol.

You can substitute candied ginger for fresh.

Add a vanilla bean.

[Brazilian style mulled wine](https://texasdebrazil.com/churrasco-recipes/brazilian-mulled-wine-recipe-quentao-de-vinho/) doesn't seem much different from domestic mulling, though they take the less common sugar-water approach to the extra liquid.

A Good Dish recommended mix-ins: "sliced oranges, blanched slivered almonds, cinnamon sticks, raisins and chopped dried apples, apricots, pineapple or crystallized ginger."
