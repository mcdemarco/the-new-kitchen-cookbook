# Sri Lankan Roasted Curry Powder

Peter had a Sri Lankan cooking class for work (just another one of those coronavirus things), and this was one of the ingredients in [Sri Lankan Coconut Chicken Curry](../poultry/chickenCurry.md).  We made our own ahead of time, out of a bewildering variety of different recipes online.  (If you want one of those, I suppose you can't go wrong with [The BEST Sri Lankan Roasted Curry Powder](https://www.theflavorbender.com/sri-lankan-roasted-curry-powder/).)

We later used it in [Sri Lankan Beef Curry](../meat/roastedCurry.md), and it also seems like it would be good for roasting vegetables---especially ground up better than we managed to with the mortar and pestle.

Fills 1 spice jar.

## Ingredients

* 4 T. coriander seed
* 2 T. cumin seed
* 1--2 T. basmati rice (optional filler)
* 1 T. black mustard seed (or yellow mustard seed)
* 1/2 T. black peppercorns
* 1/2 T. fenugreek seed
* 1/2 T. fennel seed
* 1 tsp whole cloves
* 1 tsp green cardamom pods (crushed)
* 5--10 individual curry leaves (about 1 sprig)
* 1 dried red chili (optional, probably seeded)
* 1 short cinnamon stick (optional, about 1")

## Directions

1. In a dry stainless steel skillet, roast all ingredients (optionally separately or somewhat separately) until browned.
2. Optionally, cool.
3. Grind with a spice grinder, coffee grinder, or mortar and pestle.  (When using a mortar and pestle, you can sift out the rice and cardamon pod shells later if you have a sifter.  Even with a grinder, you should exercise caution around the cinnamon stick.)

## Variants

Some recipes involve roasting the spices in the oven.  There are some other leaves, but they sound harder to find than curry leaves.

Descriptions of roasting times vary from a few minutes to 10.

Some recipes use 3 chilis.

If you don't have some of the whole spices, you can substitute 1/3 the amount of ground spice for it.  Roast the ground version in the pan briefly when you're done with your whole spices.
