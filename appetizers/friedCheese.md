# Fried Cheese

Get some frying cheese and [fry it](https://www.thespruceeats.com/fried-halloumi-cheese-meze-1705293)!  (It's even easier to grill frying cheese, but that would lead to a more ambiguous recipe title.)

## Ingredients

* Greek or Latin American-style frying cheese (halloumi or queso de frier/queso para frier)
* olive oil (optional)
* black pepper or red pepper flakes to taste (optional)
* za'atar to taste (optional)

## Directions

1. Slice cheese to 3/8" thickness, and to the desired snacking size in the other two dimensions.
2. Pat slices dry.
2. Heat a frying pan to medium heat, with or without a small amount of olive oil.
3. Optionally, spice the cheese with the pepper(s).
4. Fry cheese in batches to a dark golden brown on both sides.
5. Remove from pan.
6. Optionally, top with olive oil and/or za'atar.
7. Serve hot.

## Variants

When grilling frying cheese, use a thin mesh screen and/or cut the slices larger and/or thicker for stability.
