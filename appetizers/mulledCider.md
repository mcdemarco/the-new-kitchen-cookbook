# Mulled Cider

This particular formulation was a non-alcoholic side to my [mulled wine](../appetizers/mulledWine.md), based partly on that and partly on [the perfect mulled apple cider recipe](https://texasheritageforliving.com/texas-travel/mulled-apple-cider-recipe/).

## Ingredients

Serves 12.

* 1 gallon fresh apple cider
* 6 cinnamon sticks
* 24 whole cloves
* 24 whole allspice
* 12 star anise
* 6 cardamom pods
* a slice of fresh ginger
* a slice of orange or lime (with peel)

## Directions

1. Simmer all ingredients one or more hours on high in a crockpot, several hours on low, or one hour on low heat on a stovetop.
2. Preferably, serve through a strainer.
3. After the first round, remove any citrus.
4. Hold on low or warm (crockpot), or over a low flame.

## Variants

Add a vanilla bean.

Top with ground nutmeg.
