# Herbes de Provence (Spice Mix)

I finally scored some savory, and have been using more spice mixes in general, so I decided to make my own Herbes de Provence, with the help of the interwebs.  Opinions vary wildly, and this  as usual.

All spices are dried leafy versions unless mentioned otherwise.  Grind the rosemary, fennel, and/or bay leaf together in a spice grinder or with mortar and pestle.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 T marjoram
* 1 1/2 T savory
* 1 T rosemary, ground
* 1 T thyme
* 1/2 T tarragon
* 1/2 T fennel seed, ground (optional)
* 1/2 T oregano
* 1 tsp. basil
* 1/4 tsp. ground bay leaf (or 1 whole bay leaf, ground)

## Variants

The inclusion of powdered bay leaf (because I also have it) is my own; crushed would match the rest of the recipe better.  In any event you still need to grind the rosemary (and possibly fennel), so feel free to grind the leafy part of one bay leaf along with it.

Small amounts of chervil, mint, and/or lavendar appear in some recipes, such as [The Spruce's](https://www.thespruceeats.com/make-your-own-herbes-de-provence-995824).
