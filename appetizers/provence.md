# Herbes de Provence (Spice Mix)

I finally scored some savory, and have been using more spice mixes in general, so I decided to make my own Herbes de Provence.  Opinions vary wildly, and this is just my personal compromise between the interwebs and my spice drawer.

All spices are dried leafy versions unless mentioned otherwise.  

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 T marjoram
* 1 1/2 T savory
* 1 T rosemary, ground
* 1 T thyme
* 1/2 T tarragon
* 1/2 T fennel seed, ground (optional)
* 1/2 T oregano
* 1 tsp. basil
* 1/4 tsp. ground bay leaf (or 1 whole bay leaf, ground)

## Directions

1. Grind the rosemary, fennel, and/or bay leaf together in a spice grinder or with mortar and pestle.
2. Mix all ingredients.
3. Store in a spare spice jar.

## Variants

The inclusion of powdered bay leaf (because I also have it) is my own; crushed would match the rest of the recipe better.  In any event you still need to grind the rosemary (and possibly fennel), so feel free to grind the leafy part of one bay leaf along with it.

Small amounts of chervil, mint, and/or lavendar appear in some recipes, such as [The Spruce's](https://www.thespruceeats.com/make-your-own-herbes-de-provence-995824).
