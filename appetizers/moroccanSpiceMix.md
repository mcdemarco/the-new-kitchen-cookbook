# Moroccan Spice Mix (Ras el Hanout)

This is good for putting on frozen vegetables, [roasted chickpeas](../appetizers/chickpeas.md), or [whiting](https://www.thespruceeats.com/whiting-moroccan-fried-fish-recipe-2394646) (1 tsp. per pound).
I've revised it to include more spices, but not too much cinnamon, a la [MarocMama](https://marocmama.com/how-to-make-ras-el-hanout/).

## Ingredients

* 2 tsp. ground ginger
* 2 tsp. ground cumin
* 2 tsp. ground mace (optional)
* 2 tsp. ground cardamom
* 1 tsp. ground coriander
* 1 tsp. ground allspice
* 1 tsp. ground nutmeg
* 1 tsp. turmeric
* 1/2 tsp. black pepper
* 1/2 tsp. white pepper (optional)
* 1/2 tsp. pure chili powder
* 1/2 tsp. sweet paprika
* 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper
* 1/4 tsp. ground cloves
* 1/4 tsp. nigella (before grinding)
* 1/4 tsp. anise seed (before grinding)
* 1/4 tsp. fennel seed (before grinding)
* 5--10 threads saffron (for grinding)
* 2--3 star anise pods (for grinding)

## Directions

1. Optionally, toast whole ingredients (except saffron) before grinding them.
2. Mix all ingredients.
3. Store in a spice jar.

## Variants

Some ingredients are optional because I don't keep them around.  
Rose petals, lavender, and orris root are other optional ingredients I don't have around.
