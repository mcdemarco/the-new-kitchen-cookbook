# Freak Out for Frico!

I saw a couple of contestants making [frico](http://thecocinamonologues.com/2012/04/03/freak-out-for-frico/) out of aged cheddar on Chopped and decided to make a sampler of Parmesan, Romano, and aged cheddar fricos. They didn't last long enough to photograph.

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
2. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
3. Grate cheese.
4. Arrange cheese in several piles on paper.
5. Bake six to eight minutes.
