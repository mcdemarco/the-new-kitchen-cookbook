# Pie Advice

Yes, pie is its own chapter.

I usually make a 9" double-shelled pie with the 9" crust recipe, but if you're bad at rolling out dough (or you want leftovers), you should up it to the 10" recipe.  There are notes about using parchment paper and plastic wrap

I don't usually measure my fruit filling as in the recipes; instead I put it into the empty pie plate until it looks like the right amount, then take it back out and measure the other ingredients.

It does help to check your oven temperature, especially if your fruit is particularly underripe and needs all the cooking specified.
