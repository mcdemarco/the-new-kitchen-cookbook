# Date Turnovers

This is a cookie recipe cut down and de-milked from The Spruce Eats' [Date Turnover Cookies](https://www.thespruceeats.com/date-turnovers-3056099).  Since the production and appearance is like turnovers, I filed them under [pie](../pie/) instead of [cookies](../cookies/), but they taste more like cookies when they're done.

Makes 24.

## Ingredients

### Crust

* 1 1/4 c. all-purpose flour 
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/8 tsp. baking soda
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 1/4 c. shortening
* 1 egg
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla

### Filling

* 1/3 lb. dates (about 2/3 c.)
* 1/4 c. sugar
* 1/4 c. water
* 1/3 tsp. vanilla
* scant 1/4 c. walnuts

### Topping

* egg white (optional)
* sanding sugar (optional)

## Directions

1. Mix flour, salt, and baking soda, and set aside.
2. Cream sugar, shortening, egg, and vanilla.
3. Stir in the flour mixture.
4. Refrigerate 1 hour.
5. Pit and chop the dates.  Chop the nuts.
6. Combine filling ingredients in a small, heavy pot and cook until thickened, then cool.
7. Preheat oven to 400° (375° with convection).
8. Roll out dough as thin as possible on a lightly floured board.
9. Cut into 3" circles.
10. Fill each with 1 tsp. filling.
11. Seal with water and pinch shut with a fork.
12. Optionally brush with egg white or water and sprinkle with sanding sugar.
13. Bake 8 minutes.

## Variants

There was a glaze included in the original recipe (in addition to the toppings).

The cookie dough is not easy to work with, so you might be better off making actual rough puff or another pastry dough and turning them into real turnovers.
