# Pear Pie

I make pear pie with somewhat underripe pears from our backyard pear tree.  This recipe is from Tennis Maynard via my friend Tom Franczak.  I added the clove, and I'm usually too lazy for the egg white.

## Ingredients

* 1 9" [double-crust pie shell](../pie/crust.md) (uncooked)
* about 6 c. peeled, cored and sliced pears 
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg 
* 1 1/2 tsp ground ginger 
* 1 tsp vanilla (I use vanilla bean paste)
* dash ground clove
* 4 T. flour
* 1 egg white for crust (optional)

## Directions

"Mix thoroughly, then pour into pie crust and proceed as normally. You do brush your crust with a partially beaten egg white, don't you? Browns nicely. Also of course the usual 3-4 slits for steam. Bake at 425° [for] 10-15 minutes, then turn down to 350° and bake another 30-35 minutes until done. Of course cool before cutting. I always put in enough fruit to make a 'dome' under the crust. Cooks down a little, makes a better pie."

## Variants

You can make pear pie just like apple pie (*q.v.*), but then it tastes just like apple pie.
