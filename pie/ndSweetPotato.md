# Non-Dairy Sweet Potato Pie

I started with [The Taste of Kosher's pie](https://www.thetasteofkosher.com/dairy-free-sweet-potato-pie/#mv-creation-164-jtr) because I was looking for something close to my [non-dairy pumpkin pie](../pie/nonDairyPumpkin.md).  It was a  bit out of control with the sugar, though.  (Apparently sweet potatoes vary in sweetness.)  [The New York Times](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1013361-coconut-sweet-potato-pie-with-spiced-crust) has an interesting version with both coconut milk and butter, that slightly reassured me about the inclusion of oil.

I usually make shortening crusts, so I just used a [single crust](../pie/crust.md) in a deepish 9" pie pan.  You can also use a store-bought pie crust.

You can make the filling in advance.

Makes: 1 pie.

## Ingredients

* one [single-crust pie shell](../pie/crust.md)
* 1 lb. sweet potatoes
* 1/2 c. (1/3 of one 14 oz. can) coconut milk
* 2 eggs
* 1/3 c. oil
* 2/3 c. brown or white sugar
* 1 tsp. ground coriander (optional)
* 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp. ginger (optional)
* dash clove (optional)
* dash allspice (optional)
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 tsp. vanilla
* 1/2 tsp. lemon extract (optional)
* flour or cornstarch (optional)

## Directions

1. Make or unwrap crust.
2. Cook sweet potatoes by [roasting, Instant Pot](../roots/roastedSweetPotatoes.md), or boiling 50 minutes.
3. Peel and mash well.
4. Mix all filling ingredients, optionally using a mixer, immersion blender, or other blender to smooth the clumpy ingredients more.  If the filling seems too watery, add flour or cornstarch.
3. Optionally, blind bake a homemade crust at 400° for 5 minutes, *filled* with pie weights and/or dried beans.  You may want to protect the edge.
4. Preheat oven to 350°.
5. Fill crust.  
6. Bake up to 1 hour until set.  Again, it's advisable to protect the edge.
7. Cool.

Refrigerate and eat within 4 days.

## Variants

Some recommend roasting the sweet potatoes for the best flavor.

Replace the coconut milk with pretty much any other non-dairy milk.

Replace spices with 1/2 T. [pumpkin spice](../appetizers/pumpkinSpice.md).
