# Non-Dairy Pumpkin Pie

I make a lot of fruit pies from scratch, but there is much to be said for the "open some cans" simplicity of pumpkin pie.  This adaptation of [Pareve Pumpkin Pie](https://jamiegeller.com/recipes/parve-pumpkin-pie/) features a can of coconut milk, though the commenters say it doesn't taste coconutty afterwards.  Bonus ingredient: rum!  Other ingredients have been added from my dairy [pumpkin pie recipe](../pie/pumpkin.md).

I usually make shortening crusts, so I just used a [single crust](../pie/crust.md).  (The original recipe did not specify a pie size, but neither does my single crust.)  You can also use a store-bought pie crust.

You can mix the filling ahead of time and refrigerate, if that helps.

Makes: 1 pie.

## Ingredients

* one [single-crust pie shell](../pie/crust.md)
* 1 lb. (or 15 oz.) can pumpkin (solid pack, 100%, pure, etc.)
* 1 c. brown sugar
* 1 egg
* 2 T. melted shortening
* 1 T. flour
* 1 tsp. ginger
* 1 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla (optional)
* dash pepper (optional)
* dash clove
* dash allspice
* 1 1/2 c. (most of one 14 oz. can) coconut milk

## Directions

1. Make or unwrap crust.
2. Mix the filling ingredients except for the coconut milk, optionally using an immersion or other blender to smooth the pumpkin more.
3. Optionally, blind bake a homemade crust at 400° for 5 minutes, *filled* with pie weights and/or dried beans.  You may want to protect the edge.
4. Preheat oven to 375°.
5. Fill crust.
6. Bake 1 hour.
7. Cool.

## Variants

The original recipe included 1/2 tsp. pepper, which has been reduced to a more reasonable quantity.
