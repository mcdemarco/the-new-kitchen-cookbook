# Cherry Pie

This is more or less the [Serious Eats Cherry Pie](http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/06/fresh-cherry-pie-filling-recipe.html), but with my crust, my starch (available from Brazilian grocery stores here), and my tendency to spice.

## Ingredients

* 1 9" [double-crust pie shell](../pie/crust.md) (uncooked)
* 28 oz. fresh or frozen pitted cherries (1 3/4 lb), optionally sweet, optionally macerated
* 1 1/2 oz (generous 1/3 c.) sour tapioca starch (polvilho azedo)
* 1 scant c. sugar
* scant 2 T. lemon juice
* 3/4 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp almond extract (optional)
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)
* 1/4 tsp nutmeg (optional)
* dash clove (optional)
* egg white (optional)
* sanding sugar (optional)


## Directions

1. Defrost cherries.
2. Make and chill dough for crust. 
3. Mix non-crust ingredients.
4. Roll out and fill bottom crust.
5. Roll out and top with top crust.
6. Chill 30 minutes.
7. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.
8. Optionally top with egg white and sanding sugar.
8. Bake 1 hour.  (The original recipe said to bake it on a cookie sheet, presumably in case of spills.)
9. Tent or otherwise shield the crust.
10. Bake 15 more minutes.
11. Cool about three hours.


## Variants

The original recipe called for regular tapioca starch, with a warning about trusting labels on food from China.

You can use canned cherry pie filling (up to 2 cans).  Skip all ingredients except spices and extract.  Optionally increase extract up to 1/2 tsp. per can.  Reduce cooking time to 45 minutes.  ([Source](https://www.loavesanddishes.net/how-to-make-cherry-pie-with-cherry-pie-filling))

You can use jarred sour cherries (drained).   Reserve 1/2 c. of the juice.  Reduce sugar, don't macerate.  ([Source](http://honestcooking.com/sour-cherry-pie-jarred-cherries-recipe/))

You can use a combination of cherry formats, as long as you do it proportionally (with the appropriate sugar, cooking time, etc.).
