# Strawberry Rhubarb Pie

This recipe is based on [King Arthur Flour's recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/strawberry-rhubarb-pie-recipe), with a bit of [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/07/easy-strawberry-rhubarb-pie-recipe.html), plus some alterations to make the weights more convenient.

## Ingredients

* 1 10" double-crust pie shell (uncooked)
* 1 lb. frozen rhubarb, chopped  (1/2 inch thick)
* 1 lb. fresh strawberries, quartered (cut smaller if they're jumbo)
* 3/4 c. white sugar
* 1/2 c. brown sugar
* at least 4 T. sour tapioca starch (polvilho azedo)
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1 T. butter or butter flavored Crisco (optional)
* 1 tsp. cinnamon (optional)
* 1 tsp. allspice (optional)
* egg for wash (optional)
* sanding sugar for topping (optional)


## Directions

1. Make and chill dough for crust. 
2. Defrost and/or chop strawberries and rhubarb.
3. Mix strawberries and rhubarb with 1/4 c. of the white sugar.  Let sit for 20 minutes, then strain.
4. Roll out and chill bottom crust (in pie plate).
5. Mix together 1/2 c. white sugar, brown sugar, starch, salt, and spices.  Add to strawberry mix and mix well.
6. Fill bottom crust.  Optionally top the filling with dabs of the butter.
7. Chill again while rolling out top crust.
8. Preheat oven to 425°F.
9. Optionally, cut top crust into large shapes or strips, or just cut shapes out of the crust.
10. Top with top crust.
11. Optionally chill for 20 minutes.
12. Optionally apply egg wash and/or sanding sugar.
13. Bake 30 minutes at 425° (optionally protecting the crust), then bake 30--40 more minutes at 375°.
14. Cool 30 minutes to an hour.


## Variants

None of the spices were in the original recipe, and all the sugar was white.

Use your own preferred egg wash, or beat 1 egg with a pinch of kosher salt.

If you don't have sour tapioca starch, you can use regular tapioca starch.
There are gelatin and other high-tech options in the original recipe, or just use 7 1/2 T. flour (1/2 c. minus 1/2 T.).
(You will have to consult the internet regarding cornstarch.)

Another possible spice is almond extract.
