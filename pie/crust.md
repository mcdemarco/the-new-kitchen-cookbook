# Crust

![watercolor pie](../images/piewc.png)

First, the crust.  My crusts all started from the basic piecrust recipe in my old Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook (which my sister said to use), but have been adjusted so I don't have to keep doing the math. 

## Ingredients 

### Single-crust pie shell

(This is half of the 10" double-crust pie recipe.)

* 1 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 2 1/2 - 3 T. cold water

### Double-crust pie shell (8")

* 1 1/2 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 1/2 c. butter-flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 3 to 4 T. cold water

### Double-crust pie shell (9")

(This should do for a 9" pie.)

* 1 3/4 c. flour 
* 1/2 c. + 1 T. + 1 tsp. butter flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 4-5 T. cold water

### Double-crust pie shell (10")

* 2 c. flour 
* 1 tsp salt 
* 2/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 5-6 T. cold water

## Directions (All Crusts)

Mix flour & salt. Cut in shortening with a pastry cutter. When pieces are pea-sized, add water gradually (a teaspoon at a time) until just damp.  (You won't need all the water.)  Squeeze into a ball.  For a double crust, divide in half.  Chill in plastic wrap for about an hour. 

Roll out bottom crust between parchment paper or a silicone pie mat and the plastic wrap.  (If making a double crust, use the larger half for the bottom crust.)  Peel off the parchment first (or don't, if using only parchment) and flip into pie plate.  Adjust carefully if necessary, then peel off the paper/wrap.

Fill with desired filling.

For a top crust, roll out the remaining dough.  (If making decorative holes instead of slit vents, punch them out now.)  Prep the seam by rubbing shortening on the top edge of the bottom crust.  Peel off one sheet of paper and center the top over the pie, then peel the other sheet off carefully.  Fold top crust under the bottom crust at the edge.  [Crimp edge](https://www.thespruceeats.com/how-to-crimp-pie-crust-4123830) of crust or press with a fork to seal.  (I usually do the fork thing.)

Optionally, brush top crust with milk, cream, or egg yolk, or use egg white and sprinkle with sanding sugar.

Cut vents into top crust (if solid) and bake as directed.
