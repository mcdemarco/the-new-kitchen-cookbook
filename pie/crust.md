# Crust

First, the crust.  My crusts all started from the basic  piecrust recipe in my old Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook (which my sister said to use), but have been adjusted so I don't have to keep doing the math.  

I usually make a 9" pie with the 9" recipe, but if you're bad at rolling out dough (or you want leftovers), you should up it to the 10" recipe.

## Ingredients 

### Single-crust pie shell

(This is half of the 10" double-crust pie recipe.)

* 1 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 2 1/2 - 3 T. cold water

### Double-crust pie shell (8")

* 1 1/2 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 1/2 c. butter-flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 3 to 4 T. cold water

### Double-crust pie shell (9")

(This should do for a 9" pie.)

* 1 3/4 c. flour 
* 1/2 c. + 1 T. + 1 tsp. butter flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 4-5 T. cold water

### Double-crust pie shell (10")

* 2 c. flour 
* 1 tsp salt 
* 2/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 5-6 T. cold water

## Directions (All Crusts)

Mix flour & salt. Cut in shortening with a pastry cutter. When pieces are pea-sized, add water gradually until just damp. Squeeze into a ball.  For a double crust, divide in half.  Chill for about an hour. 

Roll out bottom crust between parchment paper and plastic wrap.  (If making a double crust, use the larger half for the bottom crust.)  Peel off the parchment first (or don't, if using only parchment) and flip into pie plate.  Adjust carefully if necessary, then peel off the plastic wrap.  Fill with desired filling.

For a top crust, roll out the remaining dough.  Prep the seam by rubbing shortening on the top edge of the bottom crust.  Peel off one sheet and center the top over the pie, then peel the other sheet off carefully and trim and/or roll overlap under as desired.

Pinch edge of crust to seal/decorate as desired.  (I do the fork thing.)  Cut vents into top crust.  Bake as directed.
