# Spinach Pie

Although there's a crust variant to this recipe, I usually just use phyllo dough.

## Ingredients

* 8 oz. phyllo dough
* extra virgin olive oil

### Filling

* 2 lbs fresh or 2 10oz. packages frozen spinach
* 1--2 shallots sliced thin
* 10 oz. feta
* 2 tsp. dill
* 2 T. mint, diced
* dash nutmeg
* 2 eggs (optional, also highly forgettable)

## Directions

1. If using fresh spinach, cut off stems and wilt 2--3 minutes in a saucepan.
2. Squeeze water out of spinach and cut to desired size.  (Smaller is easier but larger is tastier.)
3. Mix spinach with other filling ingredients.
4. Brush 7 sheets of phyllo with olive oil and lay in a 8x12 pan with some going up the sides.
5. Fill with filling.
6. Top with 7 more sheets of phyllo brushed with olive oil.
7. Score the top layer only into 2-inch squares.
8. Bake 45 minutes at 350Â°.
9. Don't serve too hot.

## Variants

Instead of phyllo, mix 3 c. flour, 1 c. water, 2 T oil, 1/2 tsp oregano, and a dash of salt.  Divide into 3 parts, roll out into 3 layers, and divide the filling into two layers.

Substitute ricotta for half the feta, or parmesan for less than half of the feta.

Brush any leftover phyllo with pure olive oil, sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, fold into squares, score in half and bake 20 minutes with the spanakopita.
