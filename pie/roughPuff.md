# Rough Puff Pastry

Rough Puff is a puff pastry that's slightly more work than a pie dough, but much less than a real puff pastry.  (For a more traditional puff pastry method, see my recipe for Past√©is de Nata.)  There are several ways to make it, many involving grating or use of machinery, but a pastry cutter will also do.  Chillin' is the most important factor.

If you don't have a kitchen scale, [Renee Nicole](https://reneenicoleskitchen.com/rough-puff-pastry/) lists some American weights.

## Ingredients 

* much butter
* an equal weight of all-purpose flour
* about 1/4 tsp. salt per c. of flour (optionally less if using salted butter)
* about 1/3 c. cold water per c. of flour

## Directions (All Crusts)

1. Mix flour & salt.
2. Cut butter into flour with a pastry cutter.  Aim for very small pieces.
3. Optionally chill.
3. Add water to dampen the dough and form into a mass as with pie crust.
4. Chill 1/2 hour.
5. Roll out the chilled dough and fold into thirds about six times, chilling in between steps if the dough gets too sticky or crumbly.
4. Chill again until ready to use, preferably overnight.

## Variants

Most recipes prefer grating or processing the butter and folding some or all of it into the dough later in a more traditional way.

Some recipes, such as [Bon Appetit's](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/rough-puff-pastry), include milk or sugar.
