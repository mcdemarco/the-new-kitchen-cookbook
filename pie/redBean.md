# Red Bean Pie

Not to be confused with the popular [Korean Sweet Red Bean Pecan Pie](https://tastecooking.com/recipes/pecan-paht-pie/) or the Chinese and Japanese staple red bean hand pies, this red bean pie was an emergency Pi(e) Day recipe I interpolated between some [full-on bean custard](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/bean-pie) recipes and [the claim](https://thepiejournal.com/anko-pie-japans-sweet-red-bean-delight/) that you can put anko straight into a double pie crust and bake a pie.

I usually make shortening crusts, so I just used a [single crust](../pie/crust.md).  You can also use a store-bought pie crust.

Makes: 1 pie.

## Ingredients

* one [single-crust pie shell](../pie/crust.md)
* 1 c. cooked red beans or anko 
* 1 c. sugar (or additional sugar to taste if using anko)
* 2 eggs
* 1 tsp. nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla 

## Directions

1. Make or unwrap crust.
2. Mix the filling ingredients.  Mash or immersion blend to smooth whole beans or chunky anko.
3. Optionally, blind bake a homemade crust at 400° for 5 minutes, *filled* with pie weights and/or dried beans.  You may want to protect the edge.  You may want to bake it another 5 minutes after removing the weights.
4. Preheat oven to 350°.
5. Fill crust.
6. Bake 1/2 hour for anko, longer for whole beans.  Again, it's advisable to protect the edge. 
7. Cool.

## Variants

Replace nutmeg with [pumpkin spice](../appetizers/pumpkinSpice.md).

A popular approach to bean pies is to add egg yolks to the recipe and meringue the top (partway through baking) with the whites.

Try a double crust with anko, since it's already cooked down a bit.  Or add 1/2 c. milk to the anko filling to go more custardy.
