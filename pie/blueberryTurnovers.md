# Blueberry Turnovers

This is a mix of the dough from a King Arthur Flour [raspberry puff turnovers recipe](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/raspberry-puff-turnovers-recipe) (which I found in their [illustrated blog post](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2009/07/02/love-flaky-turnovers-dont-love-fussing-blitz-puff-to-the-rescue/) about the wonders of blitz puff pastry) and the filling from a Canadian Living [recipe for blueberry turnovers](http://www.canadianliving.com/food/baking_and_desserts/blueberry_turnovers.php).  I cut them both in half because it was an experiment and I was low on blueberries.

I used a small press from my old "crepe maker" turnover press set. (Here's [a similar turnover set](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/turnover-set) out of stock at King Arthur for reference.)  If you use a larger size you will need more filling, so plan accordingly or find a recipe targeted at your size of turnover.

For some reason sanding sugar (coarse white sugar) is sold in craft stores instead of supermarkets.  Who knew?

## Ingredients

### Crust

* 3/4 c. all-purpose flour 
* 1/8 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 c. butter (1 stick)
* 1/4 c. sour cream

### Filling

* 1 T. sugar
* 1 tsp. cornstarch
* 1/4 tsp. Vietnamese (or regular) cinnamon
* dash black pepper (optional)
* 1 c. frozen blueberries

### Topping

* egg white (optional)
* sanding sugar (optional)

## Directions

1. Defrost blueberries at least enough to measure them properly.
2. Cut the butter into the dry crust ingredients as with pie dough, then use all the sour cream to moisten.
3. Knead a bit and roll out, then fold in thirds.  Roll out again and fold in thirds again.
4. Chill!  (The usual half-hour is probably not enough, especially on a hot day.)
3. Mix dry filling ingredients.  Toss with blueberries in a small saucepan.
4. Bring blueberries to a boil stirring frequently, then simmer a couple of minutes until thickened.
5. Preheat oven to 400° (375° with convection).
5. Roll out dough into approximately a 9x9 inch square.
6. Cut into squares with a knife, pastry cutter, or pizza cutter, or into circles with a turnover press.
7. Fill.  Do not overfill!
8. Optionally brush the edges with egg or water before folding and crimping.
9. Optionally brush the tops with egg white and sprinkle with sanding sugar.
8. Bake 20-25 minutes.

If you have leftover dough (the downside of using a turnover press), chill it before attempting to roll out a second batch.
