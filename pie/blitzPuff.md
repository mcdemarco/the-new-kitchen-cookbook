# Blitz Puff Pastry

This is the dough from a King Arthur Flour raspberry puff turnovers recipe (which I found in their [illustrated blog post](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2009/07/02/love-flaky-turnovers-dont-love-fussing-blitz-puff-to-the-rescue/) about cheating on blitz puff pastry (which is already a cheat on puff pastry), and used for my [blueberry turnovers](../pie/blueberryTurnovers.md).  I extracted and redoubled to make quicker [feta puffs](../pie/fetaPuffs.md).  If you want weights, they were mentioned in the [original recipe](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/raspberry-puff-turnovers-recipe).

Yield: 16 4" squares.

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour 
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. baking powder
* 1 c. butter (2 sticks)
* 1/2 c. sour cream

## Directions

1. Cut the butter into the dry ingredients as with pie dough.
2. Use all the sour cream to moisten.
3. Knead a bit and roll out, then fold in thirds.  Roll out again and fold in thirds again.
4. Chill!  (The usual half-hour is probably not enough, especially on a hot day.)
5. Prepare filling of your choice.
6. Preheat oven to 400° (375° with convection).
7. Roll out dough into approximately a 16x16 inch square, or divide in half and roll both halves out to 8"x16".
8. Cut into 4" squares with a knife, pastry cutter, or pizza cutter, or into circles with a turnover press.
9. Fill.  Do not overfill!
10. Optionally brush the edges with egg or water before folding and crimping.
11. Optionally brush the tops with egg white and sprinkle with sanding sugar.
12. Bake 20-25 minutes.

If you have leftover dough (the downside of using a turnover press), chill it before attempting to roll out a second batch.
