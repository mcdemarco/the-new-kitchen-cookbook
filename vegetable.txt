# Vegetables

The best thing to do with vegetables is to fry them in olive oil and lots of garlic.  If for some reason that won't do, I've included some other things you can do with them.



## Fresh Green Vegetables

### Broccolini

This recipe is from [Mann's](http://www.veggiesmadeeasy.com/index.php/recipe/luca-broccolini®/).

#### Ingredients

* 2 bunches broccolini, trimmed to 4 inch stalks
* 1/4 c. sultanas or golden raisins
* 1/2 c. white wine
* 1/4 c. pine nuts, toasted
* chili flakes
* olive oil
* salt & pepper

#### Directions

Blanch broccolini and set aside. Plump sultanas in white wine.

In a large sauté pan, heat olive oil and add broccolini, pine nuts, sultanas and chili flakes. Sauté until heated through. Salt & pepper to taste. 

Serves 4.

### Broccoli Rabe or Rapini

Chop, separate into stems and tops/leaves.  Cook the stems partway in garlic and olive oil, then add the rest.

### Fiddleheads

Ignore the warnings and just fry these puppies in oil or butter.  (Wash them first.)


### Spinach

#### Ingredients

* handful pine nuts (optional)
* olive oil
* 3-5 cloves garlic, minced or crushed
* balsamic, wine, rice, or cider vinegar
* lots of fresh spinach
* raisins or currants (optional)

#### Directions

Optionally, toast the pine nuts in a dry saute pan.  Set aside.

Fry the garlic in the olive oil.  Add vinegar (less if you had to wash the spinach or it was frozen).  Cook the spinach, adding it in batches if necessary.  Add more vinegar as necessary.

Mix in optional pine nuts and/or raisins.


## Winter Squash

These are here so I don't have to google the directions every time I make them.  Cut them all in half first.

### Acorn Squash

Bake cut side up, filled with butter, brown sugar, maple syrup, etc., at 375° for 1 hour.

### Butternut Squash

Bake cut side down at 375° for 1 hour.

### Spaghetti Squash

Bake cut side down at 375° for 30-40 minutes.



## Moroccan Spice Mix

This is good for putting on frozen vegetables or [roasted chickpeas](http://www.kalynskitchen.com/2008/02/crispy-roasted-chickpeas-garbanzo-beans.html).

### Ingredients

* 2 tsp. ground cumin
* 1 tsp. ground coriander
* 1/2 tsp. chile powder
* 1/2 tsp. sweet paprika
* 1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. ground allspice
* 1/4 tsp. ground ginger
* 1/8 tsp. cayenne pepper
* a pinch ground cloves



## Salads


### Chickpea Salad with Fennel, Tomatoes and Olives

I got this recipe from my sister, who annotated it.  Further dialog is from her, with some edits for capitalization and the like.

#### Dressing

(I usually double the dressing.)

* 1 T red wine vinegar
* 1 clove minced garlic
* 1/2 tsp Dijon mustard
* pepper (yeah, right)
* 3 T olive oil

Add first four  ingredients to bowl, whisk then whisk in olive oil. (I throw all in a small jar and shake.)

#### Salad

* 2 c. cooked or canned chickpeas - rinsed (I use one can - the small chickpeas if you can find them)
* 1 small fennel bulb, halved vertically (remove hard core at bottom of bulb) then thinly sliced.  Reserve sprigs for garnish. (I skip the garnish.)
* 2 ripe tomatoes, diced
* 10 black olives (pitted and halved)
* 1/2 c. thinly sliced red onion
* 1/3 c. chopped fresh parsley (I skip this too; I have issues with parsley)

Toss all (except sprigs) in dressing; cover and let marinate in refrigerator 4 hours.

Serve with french bread and goat cheese or
with tuna or salmon (but not both 'cause that would be nasty).


### Cucumber Salad
