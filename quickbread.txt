## Pancakes

### Blueberry Yogurt Pancakes

![half pancakes](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/half_pancakes.jpg)

This is the recipe we came up with after not finding anything particularly helpful online about substituting yogurt for buttermilk. (The Internet did tell me that yogurt juice is actually whey; I kept it for the tartness, but it's also good for you.) We started from the Buttermilk Pancakes recipe in _The Joy of Cooking_, and used Stonyfield Farms whole milk French Vanilla yogurt, and a few too many frozen blueberries, defrosted.

#### Ingredients

* 1 c. flour
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 3/4 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1 egg
* 1 c. yogurt milk or buttermilk
* 1/2 T. (1 1/2 tsp.) oil
* 1/2 c. blueberries

#### Directions

To make yogurt milk: pour any whey off the top of the yogurt into a 2-cup glass measuring cup. Add yogurt until you reach about 1/2 c. (If you're using whole fat yogurt, avoid any separated fat.) Stir. Add rice milk (or other milk) to get up to 1 cup at buttermilk consistency.

To use instant buttermilk: add the powder with the dry ingredients and the water with the wet ingredients. 

Mix dry ingredients. Butter and heat griddle. Beat egg. Add egg and oil to yogurt milk. Mix wet mixture into dry slightly. Mix in blueberries until just mixed. Scoop batter into pancakes of about 3 1/2" diameter and cook on both sides. Bubbling may not happen. Try to keep the griddle from overheating between batches.

### Non-dairy Pancakes

This is another Recipezaar recipe (#35161) that I used to make, but that has mostly been supplanted by the dairy pancakes above.  I cut it down to two-person size and switched from margarine to oil.

#### Ingredients

* 1/4 c. cornmeal
* 1/2 c. soymilk or rice milk
* 1 egg
* 2 T. oil
* 1/3 tsp. salt
* 2 T. sugar
* 1/4 c. whole wheat flour
* 1/2 c. white flour
* 2 tsp baking powder

#### Directions

Soften the cornmeal in some of the liquid.  Preheat the griddle.

Beat together the eggs, remaining liquid, oil, and salt.
Mix in the cornmeal mixture and dry ingredients.  If not pourable, adjust as needed by adding liquid.

Grease the griddle.  Use 1/4 c. batter per pancake.  Cook until bubbly with an edge, then flip.


## Loaves

### Non-dairy Cornbread

I got this recipe from [The Joy of Kosher site](http://www.joyofkosher.com/recipes/non-dairy-cornbread/).  I'm guessing I substituted oil for the margarine when I made it, but I may have used Crisco.  I never have margarine around.

#### Ingredients

* 1 cup cornmeal
* 1 cup whole wheat flour
* 1 Tbsp Baking Powder
* 1/2 tsp Salt
* 1/4--1/3 cup sugar
* 1 Egg
* 1 cup soymilk
* 1/4 cup margarine

#### Directions

Preheat oven to 425°.  Mix dry ingredients.  Add in remaining ingredients.  Don't overmix.  Pour into a greased 8 inch square pan.  Bake 20-25 minutes.

## Muffins

### Bran Muffins for Mom

![bran muffins](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/bran_muffins.jpg)

This is a slight alteration of "Raisin Bran Muffins That Work," Recipezaar recipe #73061, that my mother likes. I made it non-dairy. I've only made the blueberry version once or twice.  I also made a diced pear version once.

#### Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* 1 c. soy milk
* 1/2 c. canola oil
* 1/4 c. molasses
* 3/4 c. brown sugar
* 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1 1/2 c. wheat bran
* 1 1/2 c. flour
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. baking powder
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1 c. raisins (or blueberries, diced pear, etc.)

#### Directions

Preheat oven to 400° F. Beat wet ingredients and sugar. Add bran and let sit 5 minutes. Dust raisins with rye or white flour. Mix other dry ingredients in separate bowl. Add flour mixture to bran mixture and stir gently. Add raisins. Fill 12 muffin cups. Bake 20 minutes.


### Savory Zucchini Muffins

This recipe is derived from [Lucini's Savory Zucchini Bread](http://www.lucini.com/recipes/category/side-dishes/savory-zucchini-bread), a 9x5 loaf, but I've only made it as muffins.  I also added currants, non-white flour, and some extra spices, but never the Parmesan.

When I'm making savory muffins I don't usually use muffin cups; I have a non-stick muffin tin.

#### Ingredients

* 1 c. chopped walnuts
* 1/2 c. currants
* 3 eggs
* 1/3 c. extra virgin olive oil, plus 1 tsp for oiling the muffin pan
* 1/3 c. soy milk with vinegar or buttermilk
* 2-3 medium zucchini, shredded (about 1 1/2 c. or 12 oz.)
* 1 1/2 c. total mixed white, whole wheat, and rye flour 
* 1/3 c. dark brown sugar
* 1/2 T. (1 1/2 tsp) baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
* 1/4 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 c. grated Parmesan cheese (optional)


#### Directions

Preheat oven to 350°. Grease muffin tin.  Toast nuts 6-8 minutes.

Whisk together eggs, oil and milk.  Mix in zucchini and currants.  Mix together flour, sugar, baking powder, soda, salt and spices in large bowl.  Add wet mixture to dry, stirring to just dampen.  Add optional Parmesan.

Spoon into muffin tin. Bake in middle of oven 25-35 minutes, or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean.  Cool 10 minutes in pan, then remove and cool on wire rack.  The original recipe suggests refrigerating overnight.
