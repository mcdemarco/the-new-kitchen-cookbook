Simmer dry spices 15 minutes. Add ginger and fruit. Simmer 15 more minutes. Squish fruit through strainer and discard rind. Strain out spices and discard. Add honey and whiskey (1/2 shot per 6 oz). Serve hot. Note: the timings are by no means precise, but avoid cooking the citrus too long or the result will be bitter.
