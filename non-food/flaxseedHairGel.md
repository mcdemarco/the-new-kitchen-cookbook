# Flaxseed Hair Gel

This recipe is from Erica "(a very curly girl)" at [The Happy Hunters](http://web.archive.org/web/20200218112527/http://thehappyhuntersblog.com/blog/13950497), though it came to me somewhat altered through a friend who had mercy on my curls, and I have altered it further.  My first batch lasted me about 3 months of use every other day or so before starting to both run out and get punky; disregard the warning in the original recipe about it only keeping for two weeks.

Use 1 dollop (or more) to coat wet curls.

## Equipment

* small stockpot
* mesh strainer
* squeeze bottle for dispensing (optional)

## Ingredients

* 1/4 c. flaxseed (a.k.a. linseed), rinsed if necessary
* 2 c. water
* 8--10 drops grapefruit seed extract (optional)
* 5--6 drops essential oil (optional, for fragrance)

## Directions

1. Bring water and flaxseed to a boil uncovered over medium heat.
2. Boil uncovered 8--10 minutes until the consistency of egg whites.
3. Strain.
4. Add any oil or extract.
5. Let cool.
6. Pour into squeeze bottle or a glass jar.
7. Refrigerate.

You can eat the strained-out flaxseeds if you like.

## Variants

I omit the grapefruit seed extract and add lavender oil.
