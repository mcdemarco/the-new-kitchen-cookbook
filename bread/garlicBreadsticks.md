# Garlic Breadsticks

Having made cinnamon flatbreads that looked a lot like breadsticks, I wanted to make some actual breadsticks with my refrigerator dough.  The artisan bread in 5 blog had [several recipes](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/tag/breadsticks) for breadsticks; mostly I went with the [Vote](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2012/11/05/vote) recipe.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb refrigerated [Master Recipe](../bread/master.md) or [olive oil](../bread/oliveOil.md) dough
* garlic powder to taste
* coarse salt to taste
* olive oil

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 450Â°, with a bread stone and a broiler pan for steam on a lower rack.
2. Divide dough into 6--8 small balls.  Roll each one out into a tube.
3. Twist and lay on parchment paper.
4. Brush each one with olive oil.
5. Sprinkle with garlic powder and salt.
6. Optionally, pour a cup of water into the broiler pan.
7. Bake 18 minutes.
