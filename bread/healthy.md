# Master Healthy No-Knead Recipe

I don't have the sequel, [Healthy Bread in 5 Minutes a Day](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312545525), but I did have some vital wheat gluten so I found the healthy [Master Recipe](http://web.archive.org/web/20161024031243/http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2009/10/26/our-new-book-healthy-bread-in-five-minutes-a-day-is-released-tomorrow-get-yourself-some-vital-wheat-gluten-and-make-our-whole-grain-master-recipe) online (not to mention their [chocolate whole wheat "cupcake" recipe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000429721)).  It turned out I didn't have as much wheat flour as I thought around, so I only made half the recipe.  I also corrected the salt back to pre-healthy levels, and the water back to cornstarch wash (since I still had some around from my last batch of rye).  The directions are for a normal free-form loaf; there are some vague instructions in the comments and [elsewhere](http://web.archive.org/web/20161115193651/http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2011/09/12/the-best-school-lunches-start-with-homemade-bread) for baking in a loaf pan.

Makes two loaves; the dough keeps in the refrigerator for two weeks.


## Ingredients

* 2 3/4 c. whole wheat flour
* 1 c. white flour
* 3/4 T. granulated yeast
* 3/4 T. kosher salt 
* 2 T. vital wheat gluten (flour)
* 2 c. lukewarm water
* 1 T. mixed seeds for crust:  fennel (or caraway or anise), sesame, poppy, etc.


## Directions

Making healthy bread is slightly different from the original 5-minute version.  The authors recommend mixing all the dry ingredients together before adding the water, cutting the dough chunk off with a serrated knife instead of ripping, letting the loaf sit for 90 minutes under plastic wrap before baking (40 minutes for unrefrigerated loaves), and preheating the stone in the oven for 30 minutes.  Otherwise, the process is just like unhealthy 5-minute bread: brush the rested loaf with cornstarch wash (or water), sprinkle with seeds, slash, and bake with steam for 30 minutes at 450Â°.
