# Olive and Rosemary Focaccia

This is a yes-knead yeast flatbread based on a recipe from [Lindsay Olives](https://www.ilovelindsay.com/recipes/green-olive-and-rosemary-flatbread).

## Ingredients

### Quarter Sheet Pan

#### Dough

* 1 c. warm water
* 1 T yeast
* 1 tsp. sugar
* 3 c. flour
* 1 tsp. salt

#### Topping

* 2 T olive oil
* 1/2 c. quartered green olives
* 1/2 tsp. coarse salt
* 2 T fresh rosemary (less if dried)

### Pie Plate

#### Dough

* 1/2 c. warm water
* 1/2 T yeast
* 1/2 tsp. sugar
* 1 1/2 c. flour
* 1/. tsp. salt

#### Topping

* 1 T olive oil
* 1/4 c. quartered green olives
* 1/4 tsp. coarse salt
* 1 T fresh rosemary (less if dried)

## Directions

1. Mix water, yeast and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer.  Pause for any yeast superstitions you may hold.
2. Add flour and salt.  (If using dried rosemary, you may want to grind it and add it to the flour instead of the toppings.)
3. Knead with a dough hook for a few minutes until the bowl is mostly clean.
4. Oil dough and let rise in the mixer bowl or another bowl for 1 1/2 hours.
5. Oil the pan.
5. Roll the dough out to 1/2" thick and place in the pan, or just press evenly into the pan.
5. Top with the first three toppings.
5. Preheat the oven to 500Â°, along with a bread or pizza stone.
6. Let rise 30 minutes.
7. Optionally, make depressions in the dough with your fingers and  drizzle with more oil.
8. Put the pan on the stone.
9. Bake 10 minutes.
10. Add rosemary and bake 4 more minutes or until medium brown.

Serve warm.

## Variants

The original recipe called for spreading the dough out to 8" x 10", but that seemed a bit thick for focaccia so I spread it further.  (A quarter sheet pan is 9"x13".)

Focaccia doesn't need this much rising time, so feel free to cut some corners.

If you get frustrated with the olives and garlic falling off, you can mix them into the dough.
