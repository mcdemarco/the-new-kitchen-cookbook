# Rosemary Boule with Kalamata Olives

![Rosemary boule](../images/Rosemary_boule.jpg)

This is just the standard 5-minute bread recipe using both the herb and olive bread variants.  I only rolled olives into my last loaf (out of the batch of four), since I was too busy for that step with the other three.

## Additional Ingredients

* 1 1/2 tsp. fresh rosemary (per 4 loaves)
* 1/2 tsp. dried thyme (per 4 loaves)
* [cornstarch wash](../bread/cornstarch.md)
* 1/4 c. halved olives (per loaf)

## Directions

Add herbs while mixing the [master recipe](../bread/master.md).

To add olives, roll out the dough for one loaf, spread olives around, and roll it back up into a loaf.  Let rise a bit longer than usual, then bake normally.

Use cornstarch wash instead of flour to decorate the loaf.

To keep the olives from popping out of the crust, I left a big oliveless space in the rolled-out dough and folded that over the top of the rolled-up section. This did not keep them from popping out of individual slices.

## Variants

The official herb variant called for 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary or 1 tsp fresh. I had extra fresh rosemary (which I chopped a bit) so I cut back on the thyme, originally 1 tsp dried or 2 tsp fresh.
