# Pizza Stone Pizza

If you have a 14" pizza stone, you can make _Artisan Bread in 5_ pizza from various refrigerator doughs.  (See my dough index for the full list.)  The ingredients are much like my [pan pizza recipe](../bread/panPizza.md), but it cooks faster and crispier, and no rising time is needed.

## Ingredients

* 1--1 1/4 lbs refrigerated [olive oil](../bread/oliveOil.md) or [Master Recipe](../bread/master.md) no-knead dough
* 1/4 lb shredded mozzarella
* 1 T. parmesan (optional)
* pizza or pasta sauce
* oregano
* basil
* sliced garlic or garlic powder
* 1 can anchovies (optional)
* sliced olives (optional)


## Directions

1. Preheat the oven and stone to 550°.
2. Using minimal but adequate flour, roll dough out on parchment paper into approximately the shape of the pizza stone.
3. Transfer dough to a peel or flat cookie sheet.
3. Spread sauce on pizza, not too thickly.  ![sauced](../images/pizza_sauced.png)
4. Season to taste.  ![spiced](../images/pizza_spiced.png)
5. Distribute cheese.  ![cheesed](../images/pizza_cheeed.png)
6. Distribute remaining toppings.  ![topped](../images/pizza_topped.png)
7. Transfer dough carefully to stone.
7. Bake 10--15 minutes.  Use a knife to poke holes in any bubbles you may spot.
8. Check pizza for doneness at 8 minutes and remove the parchment paper at that point.  ![cooked](../images/pizza_cooked.png)
9. Let cool 5 minutes before slicing.

## Variants

You're supposed to use a floured peel, but that's just too difficult compared to the parchment paper method.

Instead of anchovies, crumble and sprinkle 4 oz. of raw ground Impossible Burger onto the pizza before cooking.

You can use [pesto](https://web.archive.org/web/20180118035738/https://www.crazyforcrust.com/caramelized-onion-pesto-flatbread-pizza/) instead of red/pizza sauce; in that case reduce the temperature to 450° or so.

For white pizza, omit the pizza sauce and add 4 oz. ricotta, plus optionally up to 4 oz. grated parmesan or other hard cheese.

If you don't have pizza sauce and object to putting pasta sauce on pizza, it's easy to [make your own]().
