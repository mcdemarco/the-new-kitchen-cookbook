# Bread Advice

I've made many breads and bread-like things, but my favorite is no-knead bread.  Why knead when you don't have to?  My no-knead source is [Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/).  You can find the basic recipe online; see my [master recipe](../bread/master.md) and [healthy recipe](../bread/healthy.md) pages for more details.

Most of the variants I make from the book involve substituting a cup of something else for a cup of white flour in the basic recipe:  a cup of rye flour (and some caraway seed) for rye bread; half a cup of rye flour and half a cup of whole wheat flour for "peasant" bread.  Some involve shape, like slathering a lump of the basic dough into a flat rectangle on parchment paper, letting it rise while the oven is preheating to 450Â°, dusting it with flour, baking for 20 minutes, and presto, ciabatta!

Other fast shapes include [naan](../bread/naan.md), [pizza](../bread/pizzaPizza.md), [baguettes](../bread/baguette.md), and [za'atar bread](../bread/zaatar.md), a nice flatbread with za'atar (spice mix) and olive oil. 

This chapter also includes several traditional-knead breads, some non-bread accoutrements for your bread (like [cornstarch wash](../bread/cornstarch.md)), and an [index](../bread/artisanIndex.md) of which *Artisan Bread in 5* breads you can make with which doughs.
