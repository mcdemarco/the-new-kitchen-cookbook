# Bread Advice

I've made many breads and bread-like things, but my favorite is no-knead bread.  Why knead when you don't have to?  My no-knead source is [Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/).  You can find the basic recipe online; see my [master recipe](../bread/master.md) and [healthy recipe](../bread/healthy.md) pages for more details.

Most of the variants I make from the book involve substituting a cup of something else for a cup of white flour in the basic recipe:  a cup of rye flour (and some caraway seed) for rye bread; half a cup of rye flour and half a cup of whole wheat flour for "peasant" bread.  Some involve shape, like slathering a lump of the basic dough into a flat rectangle on parchment paper, letting it rise while the oven is preheating to 450Â°, dusting it with flour, baking for 20 minutes, and presto, ciabatta!

Other fast shapes include [naan](../bread/naan.md), [pizza](../bread/pizzaPizza.md), [baguettes](../bread/baguette.md), and [za'atar bread](../bread/zaatar.md), a nice flatbread with za'atar (spice mix) and olive oil. 

This chapter also includes several traditional-knead breads, some non-bread accoutrements for your bread (like [cornstarch wash](../bread/cornstarch.md)), and an [index](../bread/artisanIndex.md) of which *Artisan Bread in 5* breads you can make with which doughs.

[KitchenAid] has [a page](https://www.kitchenaid.com/pinch-of-help/stand-mixers/tips-for-making-bread-with-stand-mixer.html) about the process of making bread in a stand mixer.  To summarize: mix the dry ingredients in the warmed mixer bowl using the dough hook, then slowly add the water (other wet ingredients weren't mentioned), all at a speed of 2.  On the no-knead front, the Artisan Bread in 5 folks recommend a stand mixer for their drier doughs, such as [their holiday book white bread dough](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2018/11/22/white-bread-master-recipe-from-holiday-and-celebration-bread-in-five/) (with weights), but say to use a paddle rather than a dough hook for their wetter doughs.  They [aren't picky](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2014/03/25/the-flatbread-braid-new-video-how-to-braid-a-flat-circle/) about the order of wet vs. dry ingredients unless they include vital wheat gluten.
