# Olive Oil Dough

My favorite _Artisan Bread in 5_ recipe isn't the master recipe but the olive oil dough.  I use it for pizza, flatbread, and ciabatta.  

You can get the Artisan Bread in 5 olive oil dough recipe [here](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2011/10/25/pizza-margherita-and-a-pizza-making-package-red-star-yeast-king-arthur-flour-emile-henry-pizza-stone-a-signed-pizza-book-giveaway/).  Some weights for it are listed on my [bread math page](../bread/math.md).
