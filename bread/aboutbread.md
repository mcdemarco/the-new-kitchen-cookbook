I've made many breads and bread-like things, but my favorite is no-knead bread.  Why knead when you don't have to?  My no-knead source is [Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/).  You can find the basic recipe online in the book's blog: [Master Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/04/27/great-coverage-in-the-week-magazine-but-there-was-one-little-problem), and elsewhere.  Most of the variants I make involve substituting a cup of something else for a cup of white flour in the basic recipe:  a cup of rye flour (and some caraway seed) for rye bread; half a cup of rye flour and half a cup of whole wheat flour for "peasant" bread. 

I also found a [lighter rye variant](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2010/03/29/my-favorite-rye-isnt-in-our-books-heres-how-to-slash-it-careful-its-sticky) online with only half a cup of dark rye flour, intended to simulate medium rye, but Peter was not particularly impressed.

See below for the master recipe from the "healthy" sequel.  I found some more recipes from the book (which I don't have) online at [King Arthur Flour](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2010/02/14/when-trends-collide-no-knead-meet-whole-grain/).

This chapter also includes some non-bread things you may need for your bread.
