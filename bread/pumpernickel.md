# Pumpernickel Loaf

I wanted to knead (with my stand mixer) one loaf instead of making my two-loaf [no-knead rye bread recipe](../bread/rye.md), so I divided and tweaked Gemma Stafford's two-loaf [steakhouse pumpernickel rye recipe](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/steakhouse-style-pumpernickel-bread/#wprm-recipe-container-39537).

## Ingredients

* 3/4 c. lukewarm water
* 1/4 c. molasses
* 2 1/2 tsp. yeast
* 1 T. olive oil
* 1/2 T kosher salt
* 1 1/4 c. white flour
* 1 c. whole rye flour
* 1 T. cocoa powder (optional but recommended)
* 1 tsp. caraway seed or 1 1/2 T. minced dried onion (optional)

## Directions

1. Combine liquid ingredients, yeast, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer.
2. Wait for the yeast to bubble if you don't trust it.
3. Mix dry ingredients separately, then add to the stand mixer bowl.
4. Knead with the dough hook on low (2) for about 8 minutes.
5. Let rise in an oiled bowl for about an hour and a half, until doubled in size.
5. Grease a loaf pan and/or line the bottom with parchment paper.
6. Punch down and shape into a 10" squareish trapezoid.
7. Roll up from the shortest side.  
8. Place into the loaf pan seam down, and tuck the ends of the roll down, too.
9. Let rise 45 minutes until doubled in size.
10. Preheat oven to 375Â°, optionally with a steam pan.
11. Insert loaf and, optionally 1 c. hot water for steam.
12. Bake for 40 minutes.
13. Remove from oven, remove from pan, remove parchment paper.
14. Cool before slicing.


## Variants

You can make this by hand.  Mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, then add dry to wet.

I usually warm up the bowl with hot water before starting.

For rolls, divide the dough into 2 ounce pieces, let them rise half an hour until doubled in size, slash the tops, and bake 15--20 minutes.  (This variant was inspired by King Arthur Flour's [deli rye roll recipe](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/deli-rye-rolls-recipe).)
