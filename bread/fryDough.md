# Fry Dough(nuts)

You can fry no-knead dough just as it is, or you can fill it first.  The doughnut version below is cut down from the Artisan Bread in 5 recipe for [Savory Doughnuts](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2011/12/20/savory-doughnuts/).  I used olive oil dough the first time because that was what I had around.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 lb. no-knead dough (any style)

### Filling

* 1 c. ricotta
* 1/4 tsp. oregano
* 1/8 tsp. nutmeg
* salt to taste
* pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Bring 3" of oil to 370Â°.  (If already frying, any similar temperature will do.)
2. Mix filling (optional).
3. Roll out dough to 1/4" and cut into 8 pieces.  (If not filling the dough, you can divide it into fewer portions, stretching them flat by hand.)
4. Optionally divide filling into 1/8 c. portions and wet and pinch dough shut around it (like ravioli).
5. Fry about 2 minutes per side or until golden.  This can take longer with larger pieces.
6. Drain on a rack or paper towels.
7. Serve hot, optionally with butter, pesto, or tomato sauce.

## Variants

Fry dough is sometimes fried in a skillet instead of deep fried.
