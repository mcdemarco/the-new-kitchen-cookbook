# Pizza Sauce

If you object to putting pasta sauce on pizza and don't have any pizza sauce at hand, it's easy to make.  I cut down [A Clean Bake's recipe](https://acleanbake.com/easy-homemade-pizza-sauce-recipe/) and added some ingredients and procedures spotted elsewhere.

## Ingredients

* 1 c. canned whole or crushed tomatoes (or fresh)
* 1/3 can tomato paste
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/8 tsp. garlic powder
* dash chili powder (optional)
* oregano, basil, and/or marjoram to taste
* black pepper to taste

## Directions

1. Mix, optionally with an immersion blender.
2. Apply to pizza.

Refrigerate or freeze the remainder.

## Variants

The original recipe involved cooking the sauce down a bit, but many allege true pizza sauce should be raw until cooked on the pizza.
