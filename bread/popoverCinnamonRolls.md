# Cinnamon Rolls in a Popover Pan

This recipe was inspired by the Artisan Bread in 5 blog [Cinnamon Roll Kulich recipe](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2020/04/07/kulich-for-easter-two-ways-plus-a-book-red-star-yeast-giveaway/) (scroll past the Kulich section), sans saffron, cut down to fit my single popover pan.

Makes 6.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 lb refrigerated Brioche dough
* 1 T butter, melted and cooled
* 1/4 c. brown sugar
* 1/2 T cinnamon
* pinch salt

### Icing

* 1/4 c. confectioner's sugar
* 1 T cream
* sprinkles (optional)

## Directions

1. Butter the pan.
2. Roll dough out into a rectangle 1/4" thick.
3. Brush with butter.
4. Mix remaining (non-icing) ingredients and spread over the dough, using your hands to even it out.
5. Roll the dough up from the long side.
6. Cut carefully into six equal pieces using a bread knife or string and place in the popover pan.
7. Cover and let rise 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator plus 45 minutes on the counter in the morning.
8. Preheat oven to 350Â°.
9. Bake 20--30 minutes.
10. Invert pan immediately (because of the melted sugar) onto a rack.
11. Mix sugar and cream for icing and ice.  Optionally top with sprinkles.

## Variants

Use a batch of variant Brioche dough made with 1/4 tsp. saffron per pound/loaf, added in with the wet ingredients.

When skipping the saffron, you can toss in some zest.

These are pretty much the same as [their regular cinnamon rolls](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2011/03/28/2897/), so if you have a whole pound of brioche to use up, scale up the filling and make a couple more freeform rolls.  For a quick rise, try [their cinnamon twists](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2017/02/27/cinnamon-twists/) (but reduce the time and/or temperature).
