# Pan Pizza

The _Artisan Bread in 5_ book assumes you're going to cook your pizza at ∞° on your good bread stone, oiling up the stone and smoking up the house.  I wanted to cook mine at a more reasonable temperature on a cookie sheet, a la the BakerMama's recipe for [sheet pan pizza](http://thebakermama.com/recipes/sheet-pan-pizza/).

## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 lb or more refrigerated [Master Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/04/27/great-coverage-in-the-week-magazine-but-there-was-one-little-problem) or olive oil no-knead dough
* 1/4 lb shredded mozzarella
* 1 T. grated parmesan (optional)
* pasta or pizza sauce
* 1 can anchovies (optional)
* oregano

## Directions

1. Using minimal but adequate flour, roll dough out on parchment paper into approximately the shape of the target pan, going up the sides if possible.
2. Let dough rest for 20--30 minutes while preheating the oven to 450°.
3. Flatten if it's getting too poofy.
4. Spread sauce on pizza, not too thickly.  Season to taste.
5. Spread cheeses.
6. Distribute any toppings.
7. Bake 15--25 minutes, turning the oven down to 425° if the edges get too brown.
8. Let cool 5 minutes before slicing.

## Variants

The book mentions other doughs than the two listed; see my dough index for details.
