# Tiropsomo (Feta-Stuffed Flatbread)

This is a yeast flatbread remixed from a couple of recipes at [Dimitra's](https://www.dimitrasdishes.com/greek-feta-bread-tiropsomo-soft-delicious/) [Dishes](https://www.dimitrasdishes.com/cheesy-feta-stuffed-flatbreads/), using [no-knead olive oil dough](../bread/oliveOil.md)

## Ingredients

* 1 grapefruit-sized chunk of (preferably) olive oil no-knead dough (1 lb.)
* 2 T melted butter
* feta 
* mozzarella and/or cream cheese (optional)
* dried or fresh mint, or oregano, to taste
* black pepper (optional)
* sesame seeds (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425° (400° for individual pieces).
2. Oil a pie plate or line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
3. Sprinkle dough with flour, divide dough in half or into 3--4 personal-sized portions, and shape into balls.
4. Flatten to 1/4" thick.  If making one flatbread, place half the dough into the baking pan.  Brush all dough with butter.
5. Mix remaining ingredients (not including butter or sesame seeds) and top the prepared dough with the filling.
6. Cover with the second piece of dough and pinch shut, or pinch all pieces shut and reflatten.
7. Brush the new tops with more butter and optionally sprinkle with sesame seeds.
8. Bake 15 minutes (small) or 25--30 minutes (large) until golden with some brown spots.
9. Serve warm.

## Variants

The single-flatbread version is the traditional one; see the [original recipe](https://www.dimitrasdishes.com/greek-feta-bread-tiropsomo-soft-delicious/) for the squishier traditional dough.

Add olives or spinach to the stuffing.

Nigella would be a tasty addition or replacement for the sesame seeds.
