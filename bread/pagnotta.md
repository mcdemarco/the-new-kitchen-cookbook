# Pagnotta

This recipe is adapted from _The Il Fornario Baking Book_, which has an oversized notion of a loaf of bread and uses bread flour.  It also requires a biga and an infinite amount of time between all the kneading and rising.

Makes: 2 loaves.

## Equipment

* baking stone
* broiler pan (or spray bottle)

## Ingredients

* 3/8 c. biga (defrosted if frozen)
* 1/4 c. warm water
* 1 tsp. yeast
* 3 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
* 1 T. vital wheat gluten (adjust for the protein content of your flour)
* 1/2 T. salt
* 1 3/8 c. cool water
* cornmeal (optional)

## Directions

1. Let the biga warm up some (if it was refrigerated).
2. Mix the yeast into the warm water in a small bowl and let sit 15 minutes.
3. Mix the gluten, flour, and salt in a large bowl.  Don't forget the gluten.
4. Add all remaining ingredients (except cornmeal) to the flour and mix with a spoon until incorporated.
5. Knead by hand in the bowl for 5 minutes.
6. Knead on a floured surface for about 15 minutes.
7. Transfer to an oiled bowl (flipping to coat with oil) and cover.
8. Let rise 1 1/2 hour or until doubled.
9. Punch down, fold dough into center, turn over, and re-cover.
10. Let rise 1 hour.
11. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board.  Divide in half.
12. Fold each half of the dough into the center to form a round ball.
13. Place loaves rough side down onto a heavily floured board and cover.
15. Preheat oven (with stone and broiler pan) to 425°.
14. Let loaf rise about 45 minutes, until it springs back from your touch.
15. Dust some parchment paper (on/or a cutting board or other peel-like surface) with cornmeal, semolina, or flour.
16. Gently flip the loaf onto the parchment paper, revealing the floury rough side of the loaf.
17. Slide the loaf (with paper) onto the stone.
18. Carefully pour 1 cup hot water into the broiler pan (or mist the oven with water).
19. Bake 5 minutes.
20. Lower the oven temperature to 400° and remist, if misting, or restock the broiler pan if it's low.
21. Bake 35--40 minutes, removing the parchment paper partway through.
22. Cool on a rack.


## Variants

You can also form the same amount of dough into

* the single massive loaf from the book (increase time to 40--50 minutes)
* 12 rolls
* a reasonable loaf plus 6 rolls

Both rolls and mega-loaves are formed as described above.  When baking rolls, reduce time to 20--30 minutes.
