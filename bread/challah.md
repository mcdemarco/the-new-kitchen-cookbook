# Yes-Knead Challah

I've made the challah no-knead recipe, and I've also made the challah recipe in *The Book of Jewish Food* by Claudia Roden.  I usually cut them both down to 2 loaves for convenience.  In the latter I also altered the flour (for reasons that were not penciled in) and found an actual poppy measurement, as follows.

Makes 2 loaves.

## Ingredients

* 1 T. yeast
* 1 1/8 c. bread-temperature water
* 1/4 c. sugar or honey
* 2 eggs (plus half an egg for the top)
* 1/2 T. salt
* 1/4 c. oil
* 4 c. flour
* 3/4 c. raisins (optional)
* 1/2 T. poppy or sesame seeds (optional)

## Directions

1. Mix everything but the flour, raisins, and seeds well.
2. Add flour gradually.
3. Knead 15 minutes.  (You may need extra flour if you chose the honey option.)
4. Put in an oiled bowl and flip to coat with oil.
5. Cover with plastic wrap and let double in size (2-3 hours).
6. Punch down, add optional raisins, knead, and divide in two.
7. To shape each loaf, roll out that portion of dough into ropes:  one for a round loaf or three for a braid.
8. Coil up from the end (for a round loaf) or braid from the middle.
7. Let the shaped loaves rise another hour on an oiled cookie sheet or on parchment paper.
8. Brush with the half egg and sprinkle with optional seeds.
9. Bake at 350Â° for 30-40 minutes.
