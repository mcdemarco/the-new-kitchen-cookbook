# Yes-Knead Challah

I've made the challah no-knead recipe, and I've also made the challah recipe in *The Book of Jewish Food* by Claudia Roden.  I usually cut them both down to 2 loaves for convenience.  In the latter I also altered the flour (for reasons that were not penciled in) and found an actual poppy measurement, as follows.

Makes 2 loaves.

## Ingredients

* 1 T. yeast
* 1 1/8 c. bread-temperature water
* 1/4 c. sugar or honey
* 2 eggs plus half an egg for the top
* 1/2 T. salt
* 1/4 c. oil
* 4 c. flour
* 3/4 c. raisins (optional)
* 1/2 T. poppy or sesame seeds (optional)

## Directions

1. Mix everything but the flour, raisins, and seeds well.
2. Add flour gradually.  (You may need extra if you chose the honey option.)
3. Knead 15 minutes.
4. Put in an oiled bowl and flip to coat with oil.
5. Cover with plastic wrap and let double in size (2-3 hours).
6. Punch down, add optional raisins, knead, divide into two, and shape.  To shape, form into one or three ropes and coil up (one) from the end or braid (three) from the middle.
7. Let rise another hour on an oiled cookie sheet or on parchment paper.
8. Brush with the half egg and sprinkle with optional seeds.
9. Bake at 350Â° for 30-40 minutes.
