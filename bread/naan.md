# Garlic Naan

I was perusing the 5 Minutes a Day blog, probably in search of good rye bread, when I came across a mention of naan as being one of readers' favorites from the original book.  "There's naan in there?" I asked myself, and when I looked there was, indeed, naan in there.  I googled for more naan ingredients and decided to go with garlic, plus some other things I didn't measure very well. 

Note you need a cast iron frying pan (or other durable pan) with a lid for this recipe.  

## Ingredients (1 naan)

* 1 peach-sized chunk of an allowed dough (see the Artisan Bread Index) or olive oil dough
* about 3 cloves garlic, diced
* chopped garlic scapes, ground cumin, or ground coriander (optional)
* canola oil

## Directions

1. Roll out each naan to about 1/8" thickness.  I used generous amounts of flour and a piece of parchment paper.
2. Sprinkle naan with the remaining ingredients.  If they're wet and/or sticky, you can add some flour to make them more spreadable.  
3. Roll over the garlic again to make it stick to the dough better.
4. Heat a 10" or larger cast iron pan on the stovetop until water dances on it.
5. Add canola oil to the pan.
6. Put the naan in garlic-side down, optionally with the help of the parchment paper.  Smooth out any wrinkles.
7. Cover and cook 3 minutes.  (This is your steam step.)
8. Uncover, flip naan, and cook uncovered for up to 3 more minutes.
9. Check the heat of the pan and re-oil before starting the next naan.

The goal is to get burnt spots on the naan without burning it more thoroughly.
