# Pumpkin Yeast Bread

The internet was not forthcoming about adding pumpkin to yeast bread without going overboard, but eventually I found a recipe [at Supergolden Bakes](https://www.supergoldenbakes.com/no-knead-pumpkin-bread/#wprm-recipe-container-45375).  I cut it down and otherwise adulterated it.

Makes: 1 loaf

## Ingredients

* 1/2 c. lukewarm water
* 1 T. maple syrup
* 1/2 T. yeast
* 1/4 tsp. salt
* 1/4 tsp. nutmeg or pumpkin spice
* 1/2 c. pumpkin puree
* 2 c. white flour
* 1/4 c. whole rye flour (optional)

## Directions

1. Combine yeast, water, and maple syrup in the bowl of a stand mixer.
2. Wait for the yeast to bubble if you don't trust it.
3. Add pumpkin and stir or mix with the dough hook (just so there isn't a paddle to clean, too).
4. Mix dry ingredients separately, then add to the stand mixer bowl.  If you're not using rye flour, replace it with white flour. 
5. Knead with the dough hook on low (2) for about 8 minutes.
6. Let rise in an oiled bowl for about an hour and a half, until doubled in size.
7. Punch down and shape dough into a round loaf.
8. Let rise 45 minutes on parchment paper, optionally in a bowl for shaping, until doubled in size.
9. Preheat oven to 450°, with a dutch oven.
10. Insert loaf and parchment paper carefully into the hot dutch oven.
11. Bake covered for 30 minutes.
12. Uncover, reduce heat to 425°, remove parchment paper if possible, and bake 15 more minutes.
13. Remove from oven and dutch oven to a rack.
14. Cool completely before slicing.


## Variants

You can make this by hand.  Mix the dry and wet ingredients separately, then add dry to wet.

I usually warm up the bowl with hot water before starting.

You can bake it on a bread stone with a steam pan instead of using a dutch oven.
