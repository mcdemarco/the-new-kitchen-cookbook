# Bread Math

Sometimes you want a little less than the full *Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day* [Master Recipe](../bread/master.md).  The basic unit here is a loaf.

Note that an eighth of a cup is 2 T., and 3/4 T is 2 1/4 tsp.  Note also that small measurements should be done by volume even when weights are provided (unless your scale is extraordinarily accurate).
