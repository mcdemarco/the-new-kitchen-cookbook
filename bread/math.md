# Bread Math

Sometimes you want a little less than the full *Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day* [Master Recipe](../bread/master.md).  The basic unit here is a loaf.

Note that an eighth of a cup is 2 T., and 3/4 T is 2 1/4 tsp.  Note also that small measurements should be done by volume even when weights are provided (unless your scale is extraordinarily accurate).

Conversion to weights are mostly based on the Artisan Bread in 5 blog, sometimes directly and sometimes via the [FAQ on weighing ingredients](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2015/03/30/no-knead-whole-grain-baguette-buns-with-extra-sourdough-kick-this-time-weigh-out-the-ingredients/), which gives the following weights:

* 1 c. all-purpose flour = 141.7 g.
* 1 c. whole wheat flour = 127.6 g.
* 1 c. water = 226.8 g.
