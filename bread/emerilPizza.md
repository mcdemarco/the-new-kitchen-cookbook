# Emeril Pizza

This is just something we made up to do with matzah during Passover.  You can usually fit 2 or 2 1/2 onto a cookie sheet.

If your matzah is getting stale, toast it first to restore crispness.

## Ingredients

* square(s) of matzah, any type
* shredded cheese to taste
* [Essence of Emeril](../appetizers/emeril.md) to taste

## Directions

1. Turn on the broiler.
2. Place matzah on cookie sheet.  
3. Top with cheese and sprinkle with Emeril.
4. Broil until cheese is melted.
5. Serve hot.
