# Master No-Knead Recipe

You can get the *Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day* master recipe online in the book's blog: [Master](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2013/10/22/the-new-artisan-bread-in-five-minutes-a-day-is-launched-back-to-basics-updated) [Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/04/27/great-coverage-in-the-week-magazine-but-there-was-one-little-problem), and elsewhere, or [by weight](https://artisanbreadinfive.com/2007/11/26/question-about-weighing-the-flour/#comment-249).

Some weights for it are listed on my [bread math page](../bread/math.md); here's the short version:

* 680 g. dough-temperature water
* 14 g. yeast (1 1/2 T.)
* 25 g. kosher salt (1 1/2 T.)
* 910 g. all purpose flour

The master recipe from the "healthy" sequel to _Artisan Bread in 5_ is a nice, heavy bread.  You can find it [here](../bread/healthy.md) or online.  I found some more recipes from the sequel (which I don't have) online at [King Arthur Flour](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/blog/2010/02/14/when-trends-collide-no-knead-meet-whole-grain/).
