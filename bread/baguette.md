# Baguette

These are a combination of the baguettes in the _Artisan Bread in 5_ book and the recipe on the back of [my birthday baguette pan](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/8175283/).  Oiling the non-stick baguette pan seemed to be unnecessary.

## Equipment

* baguette pan
* broiler pan

## Ingredient

* 1 lb refrigerated [Master Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/04/27/great-coverage-in-the-week-magazine-but-there-was-one-little-problem) dough

## Directions

1. Using plenty of flour, roll dough out into 1 or 2 cylinders, 2 inches in diameter.
2. Dust the baguette pan with flour and place the proto-baguettes in there.
3. Preheat oven to 450° for 20 minutes, with a broiler pan for steam a lower rack.
4. Brush baguette(s) with water.
5. Optionally, slash them.
6. Place baguette pan in oven and pour 1 c hot water into the broiler pan.
7. Bake 25 minutes, turning the oven down to 425° if the baguettes get too brown.

It's hard to slash baguettes when they're in the baguette pan.  Fortunately, Peter likes the aliens-exploded-out-of-this-loaf look.
