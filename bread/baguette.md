# Baguette

![baguettes, top view](../images/baguettes1.png)

These baguettes are a combination of the baguettes in the _Artisan Bread in 5_ book and the instructions on the back of [my birthday baguette pan](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/8175283/).  Beware of the nasty glue on that one; you might want to buy an [alternative baguette pan](http://www.chicagometallicbakeware.com/non-stick-perforated-baguette-pan.html).

Oiling the non-stick baguette pan seems to be unnecessary.

## Equipment

* baguette pan
* broiler pan

## Ingredient

* 1 lb refrigerated [Master Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/04/27/great-coverage-in-the-week-magazine-but-there-was-one-little-problem) dough

1. Using plenty of flour, roll dough out into 1 or 2 cylinders, 2 inches in diameter.
2. Dust the baguette pan with flour and place the proto-baguettes in there.
3. Let baguettes rest for 20 minutes while preheating the oven to 450°, with a broiler pan for steam on a lower rack.
4. Brush baguette(s) with water and, optionally, slash them crosswise.
6. Place baguette pan in oven and pour 1 c hot water into the broiler pan.
7. Bake 25 minutes, turning the oven down to 425° if the baguettes get too brown.

It's hard to slash baguettes when they're in the baguette pan (try lengthwise instead), or if the dough is very moist.  Fortunately, Peter likes the aliens-exploded-out-of-this-loaf look.

## Variants

The book doesn't mention any other doughs that work as baguettes, but I was able to make them with the Light Whole Wheat dough (the one with 5 1/2 c. white and 1 c. whole wheat).

I assume that the Peasant Bread dough (substitute 1/2 c. rye for 1/2 c. of the whole wheat) would also work, but I haven't tried it yet.
