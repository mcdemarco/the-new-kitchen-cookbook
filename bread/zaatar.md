# Za'atar Bread

This is a yeast flatbread from the *Artisan Bread in 5* cookbook, using no-knead dough and za'atar.  Za'atar is a Middle Eastern spice mix named after one of its ingredients, though which one varies.  (And I thought "black cumin" was vague...)

## Ingredients

* 1 grapefruit-sized chunk of no-knead dough
* 3 T olive oil
* 1 T. za'atar
* coarse salt to taste

## Directions

1. Oil a cookie sheet.
2. Sprinkle dough with flour and shape into a ball.
3. Flatten to 1/3" thick.  Make depressions in the dough with your fingers, to the extent possible.
4. Drizzle with oil.
5. Sprinkle with za'atar and salt, taking into account the amount of salt already in your za'atar. 
6. Preheat the oven to 450Â°, along with a broiler tray for water.
7. Let rise 20 minutes.
8. Put the bread in the oven and pour a cup of hot water into the broiler tray.
9. Bake 15 minutes or until medium brown.
10. Serve warm.

## Variants

I usually make it with [olive oil dough](../bread/oliveOil.md), but see [the index](../bread/artisanIndex.md) for other possibilities.

If you don't have za'atar but you do have savory, grind it with some thyme, then add sesame seeds for a first approximation.
