# Pie!

Yes, pie is its own chapter.

## Crust

First, the crust.  My crusts all started from the basic crust recipe in my old Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook (which my sister said to use), but have been adjusted so I don't have to keep doing the math.  

I usually make a 9" pie with the 9" recipe, but if you're bad at rolling out dough (or you want leftovers), you should up it to the 10" recipe.

### Ingredients 

#### Single-crust pie shell

(This is half of the 10" double-crust pie recipe.)

* 1 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp salt 
* 1/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 2 1/2 - 3 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (8")

* 1 1/2 c. flour 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 1/2 c. butter-flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 3 to 4 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (9")

(This should do for a 9" pie.)

* 1 3/4 c. flour 
* 1/2 c. + 1 T. + 1 tsp. butter flavored Crisco (non-dairy) 
* 1/2 tsp. salt 
* 4-5 T. cold water

#### Double-crust pie shell (10")

* 2 c. flour 
* 1 tsp salt 
* 2/3 c. butter-flavored Crisco (or other shortening) 
* 5-6 T. cold water

### Directions (All Crusts)

Mix flour & salt. Cut in shortening with a pastry cutter. When pieces are pea-sized, add water gradually until just damp. Squeeze into a ball and chill. 

Roll out between parchment paper and Saran Wrap. Peel one off (I've switched from peeling off the plastic first to peeling off the parchment first), flip into pie plate, peel the other one off carefully, and trim and/or roll under as desired.  I do the fork pinching thing.

### Pecan Pie

Peter likes lots of pecans in his pie, so I found a recipe with more pecans than most.  This one is from [Martha Stewart](http://www.marthastewart.com/312503/pecan-pie).

#### Ingredients

* single-crust pie shell, rolled out and fitted into a 9-inch pie plate 
* 4 large eggs 
* 1 cup light corn syrup 
* 1/3 cup packed light-brown sugar 
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar 
* 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
* 1/2 teaspoon salt 
* 3 cups pecan halves 
* Lightly sweetened whipped cream, for serving (optional)

#### Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. with rack set in lowest position. 
2. Using kitchen shears or a paring knife, trim dough to a 1-inch overhang. With floured fingers, fold overhang under itself to form a rim; pinch between thumb and forefinger to form a uniform edge around rim of pie plate. Crimp with fingertips. Transfer dough-lined pie plate to refrigerator. 
3. Make filling: In a large bowl, whisk eggs, corn syrup, sugars, butter, vanilla, and salt until smooth; mix in pecans. Pour mixture into chilled pie crust; place pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until filling jiggles slightly in the center when gently shaken, 50 to 60 minutes. 
4. Cool pie completely in plate, 5 to 6 hours. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.
