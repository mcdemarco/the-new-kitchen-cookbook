# Bread

I've made many breads and bread-like things, but my favorite is no-knead bread.  Why knead when you don't have to?  My no-knead source is [Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/).  You can find the basic recipe online in the book's blog: [Master Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/04/27/great-coverage-in-the-week-magazine-but-there-was-one-little-problem).  Most of the variants I make involve substituting a cup of something else for a cup of white flour in the basic recipe:  a cup of rye flour (and some caraway seed) for rye bread; half a cup of rye flour and half a cup of white flour for "peasant" bread.

## Extras

Some things you may need for your bread.

### Cornstarch Wash

I'm always digging for the page that has this (51), so I put it here.

Mix 1/2 tsp. cornstarch with a little water.  Add 1/2 c. water and microwave 60 seconds or boil until glassy.


### Caramel Coloring for Pumpernickel Bread

I understand that you can get caramel color from the [King Arthur store](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/visit/) in Vermont, but I haven't yet.  Instead, I resorted to the dangerous procedure explained below by the 5-minute bread folks, which I got from [their blog](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/10/26/pumpernickel-bread-how-to-make-your-own-caramel-coloring).  The conflicting messages about whether to decrease the liquid or increase the flour were in the original.

#### Directions

"Yes, caramel color can be made at home, but not as a powder---what you make will be a liquid that is added to recipes; you should decrease the liquid a bit to account for the extra. Here’s what I’ve done at home (it won’t be quite as dark a result as powdered caramel color): 

"Put 3 tablespoons sugar and 1 tablespoon water into a saucepan. Melt the sugar over a low flame, then increase heat to medium-high, cover, and bring to a boil for 2 minutes. Add a pinch of cream of tartar and continue to boil uncovered until the mixture becomes very dark. Remove from heat and allow to cool partially. 

"Very carefully, add a quarter cup of boiling water to the pan (it may sputter and water may jump out of the pan so wear gloves and keep your face away from it). Dissolve the caramelized sugar and cool to room temp. Use about a quarter-cup of this mixture in place of commercial caramel color powder in our Pumpernickel recipe on page 67.

"If you use liquid caramel coloring like this, you need to add extra flour to make up for it– about twice the volume of flour as liquid.  Otherwise the dough will be too loose."

## My Variants

### Semi-semolina Bread

![Semi-semolina](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/Semi-semolina.jpg)

The semolina recipe in Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day warned against using non-durum semolina, but that was all I had, so I substituted 1 1/2 cups white flour for half the semolina in the recipe.

### Rosemary Boule with Kalamata Olives

![Rosemary boule](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/Rosemary_boule.jpg)

This is just the standard 5-minute bread recipe (see link below) using both the herb and olive bread variants. I only rolled olives into my last loaf (out of the batch of four), since I was too busy for that step with the other three. The herb variant called for 1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary or 1 tsp fresh. I had extra fresh rosemary (which I chopped a bit) so I cut back on the dried thyme (from 1 tsp dried or 2 tsp fresh). 

To add olives, roll the dough out, spread 1/4 cup halved olives around, and roll it back up. Use cornstarch wash instead of flour to decorate the loaf. To keep the olives from popping out of the crust, I left a big oliveless space in the rolled-out dough and folded that over the top of the rolled-up section. This did not keep them from popping out of individual slices.

### Marbled Rye

![the final product](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/the_final_product.jpg)

I made marbled rye made from two different batches of 5-minute rye bread. I had one loaf worth of pumpernickel dough left, so I decided to make a batch of deli rye and marble them. This was complicated by the wetness of the dough and the different oven temperatures specified in the two recipes. I omitted the caraway from the deli rye dough because I thought it would be weird marbled. I omitted them from the outside of one loaf to tell it apart from an all-deli loaf I made the same day. I found [some marbling advice](http://www.abreadaday.com/?p=1365) online.

#### Ingredients

* 1/2 lb pumpernickel dough
* 1/2 lb deli rye dough (without caraway seed)
* flour for dusting
* water for brushing
* cornstarch wash
* caraway seeds for sprinkling (optional)

#### Directions

Make two batches of five-minute bread: pumpernickel (p. 67 in Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day) and deli rye (p. 58). You only need half a loaf from each (about 1/2 lb or 1/2 grapefruit). I'd recommend refrigerating the pumpernickel overnight, if not both of them. 

Cut each half-loaf in half again. Roll out on a pastry board using plenty of flour. 

![quarters](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/quarters.jpg)

Starting with a deli-rye piece at the bottom, wet its top with a pastry brush and stack them up, alternating colors and wetting each top, including the last pumpernickel. 

![wet pile](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/wet_pile.jpg)

Roll up. Roll the roll, connecting its ends. Keeping the ends on the bottom, shape the loaf into an oval. Place on a piece of parchment paper. Let rise for an hour. 

![loafed](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/loafed.jpg)

Preheat the oven (with the bread stone and steam pan) for 20 minutes at 425°. Brush the loaf with cornstarch wash (p. 51). Optionally, sprinkle with caraway seeds. Slash the loaf crosswise (see picture).

![sliced](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/sliced.jpg)

Place in oven and add 1 c. hot water to the steam pan.  Bake 40 minutes, removing the parchment paper halfway through. Cool on a wire rack. 

![cooling](http://mcdemarco.net/files/recipes/cooling.jpg)

Since your remaining dough is now missing half a loaf, you may want to do this all again.





## Master Healthy Recipe

I don't have the sequel, [Healthy Bread in 5 Minutes a Day](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312545525), but I did have some vital wheat gluten so I found the healthy [Master Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2009/10/26/our-new-book-healthy-bread-in-five-minutes-a-day-is-released-tomorrow-get-yourself-some-vital-wheat-gluten-and-make-our-whole-grain-master-recipe) online (not to mention their [chocolate whole wheat "cupcake" recipe](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000429721)).  It turned out I didn't have as much wheat flour as I thought around, so I only made half the recipe.  I also corrected the salt back to pre-healthy levels, and the water back to cornstarch wash (since I still had some around from my last batch of rye).  The directions are for a normal free-form loaf; there are some vague instructions in the comments and [elsewhere](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2011/09/12/the-best-school-lunches-start-with-homemade-bread) for baking in a loaf pan.

### Ingredients

* 2 3/4 c. whole wheat flour
* 1 c. white flour
* 3/4 T. granulated yeast
* 3/4 T. Kosher salt 
* 2 T. vital wheat gluten (flour)
* 2 c. lukewarm water
* 1 T. mixed seeds for crust:  fennel (or caraway or anise), sesame, poppy, etc.

### Directions

Making healthy bread is slightly different from the original 5-minute version.  The authors recommend mixing all the dry ingredients together before adding the water, cutting the dough chunk off with a serrated knife instead of ripping, letting the loaf sit for 90 minutes under plastic wrap before baking (40 minutes for unrefrigerated loaves), and preheating the stone in the oven for 30 minutes.  Otherwise, the process is just like unhealthy 5-minute bread: brush the rested loaf with cornstarch wash (or water), sprinkle with seeds, slash, and bake with steam for 30 minutes at 450°.  

Makes two loaves; the dough keeps in the refrigerator for two weeks.



## Yes-Knead Challah

I've made the challah no-knead recipe, and I've also made the challah recipe in *The Book of Jewish Food* by Claudia Roden.  I usually cut them both down to 2 loaves for convenience.  In the latter I also altered the flour (for reasons that were not penciled in) and found an actual poppy measurement, as follows.

### Ingredients

* 1 T. yeast
* 1 1/8 c. bread-temperature water
* 1/4 c. sugar or honey
* 2 eggs plus half an egg for the top
* 1/2 T. salt
* 1/4 c. oil

* 4 c. flour
* 3/4 c. raisins (optional)
* 1/2 T. poppy or sesame seeds (optional)

### Directions

Mix everything but the flour, raisins, and seeds well.  Add flour gradually.  Knead 15 minutes.  Put in an oiled bowl and flip.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Let double (2-3 hours), punch down, add optional raisins, knead, divide into two, and shape.  To shape, form into one or three ropes and coil up (one) from the end or braid (three) from the middle.  Let rise another hour on an oiled cookie sheet or on parchment paper.  Brush with the half egg and sprinkle with optional seeds.  Bake at 350° for 30-40 minutes.

## Artisan Bread Index

The original version of Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day didn't have a useful index of which breads could be made from which doughs, and I couldn't find one online either, so I compiled my own. The page numbers are in parentheses. The variants must be mixed up separately. I've left out the non-bread recipes for now, since I usually ignore them.  (I don't know what changed in the revised version; I haven't seen it in person.)
