# Bread

I've made many breads and bread-like things, but my favorite is no-knead bread.  Why knead when you don't have to?  My no-knead source is [Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/).  You can find the basic recipe online in the book's blog: [Master Recipe](http://www.artisanbreadinfive.com/2008/04/27/great-coverage-in-the-week-magazine-but-there-was-one-little-problem).  Most of the variants I make involve substituting a cup of something else for a cup of white flour in the basic recipe:  a cup of rye flour (and some caraway seed) for rye bread; half a cup of rye flour and half a cup of white flour for "peasant" bread.

## My Variants

### Semi-semolina Bread

The semolina recipe in Artisan Bread in 5 Minutes a Day warned against using non-durum semolina, but that was all I had, so I substituted 1 1/2 cups white flour for half the semolina in the recipe.

### Marbled Rye

I made marbled rye made from two different batches of 5-minute rye bread. I had one loaf worth of pumpernickel dough left, so I decided to make a batch of deli rye and marble them. This was complicated by the wetness of the dough and the different oven temperatures specified in the two recipes. I omitted the caraway from the deli rye dough because I thought it would be weird marbled. I omitted them from the outside of one loaf to tell it apart from an all-deli loaf I made the same day. I found [some marbling advice](http://www.abreadaday.com/?p=1365) online.

#### Ingredients

* 1/2 lb pumpernickel dough
* 1/2 lb deli rye dough (without caraway seed)
* flour for dusting
* water for brushing
* cornstarch wash
* caraway seeds for sprinkling (optional)

#### Directions

Make two batches of five-minute bread: pumpernickel (p. 67 in Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day) and deli rye (p. 58). You only need half a loaf from each (about 1/2 lb or 1/2 grapefruit). I'd recommend refrigerating the pumpernickel overnight, if not both of them. 

Cut each half-loaf in half again. Roll out on a pastry board using plenty of flour. Starting with a deli-rye piece at the bottom, wet its top with a pastry brush and stack them up, alternating colors and wetting each top, including the last pumpernickel. Roll up. Roll the roll, connecting its ends. Keeping the ends on the bottom, shape the loaf into an oval. Place on a piece of parchment paper. Let rise for an hour. 

Preheat the oven (with the bread stone and steam pan) for 20 minutes at 425°. Brush the loaf with cornstarch wash (p. 51). Optionally, sprinkle with caraway seeds. Slash the loaf crosswise (see picture). Place in oven and add 1 c. hot water to the steam pan.  Bake 40 minutes, removing the parchment paper halfway through. Cool on a wire rack. 

Since your remaining dough is now missing half a loaf, you may want to do this all again.

## Artisan Bread Index

The original version of Artisan Bread in Five Minutes a Day didn't have a useful index of which breads could be made from which doughs, and I couldn't find one online either, so I compiled my own. The page numbers are in parentheses. The variants must be mixed up separately. I've left out the non-bread recipes for now, since I usually ignore them.  (I don't know what changed in the revised version; I haven't seen it in person.)
