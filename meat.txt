## Beef

### Fake Bolognese Sauce

I've never been a fan of Bolognese sauce (ground beef belongs in meatballs) but Peter likes it so we threw some together. It turned out to be easy and pretty yummy.

#### Ingredients

* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3-5 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 lb ground beef
* 2 cubes frozen basil (2 tsp.)
* red pepper flakes to taste
* 1 jar mild commercial sauce (or equivalent amount of canned tomato sauce)

#### Directions

Fry onions in olive oil in a cast iron pan. Add garlic. Add ground beef and brown. Drain off some fat, if you're that sort of person. Add basil and red pepper. Add sauce and heat through. Serve over pasta.

### Meatballs

This was once the family meatball recipe. It may have been through some telephone or dumbing down before it came to me. In addition, I removed some ground pork and Romano cheese, and added onion and an extra egg. I made it gluten-free once (when I was out of gluten) by substituting crushed generic rice chex for the bread crumbs.

#### Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1/2 cup bread crumbs
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 tsp dried parsley
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* olive oil

#### Directions

Brown the onion about 8 minutes in olive oil. Add the garlic for another minute. Remove onion and garlic from oil and put in a bowl with remaining ingredients. (Leave the pan on the heat.) Mix well. Roll into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter.

Finish cooking meatballs either in oil or in sauce.

This is the sauce that goes with the meatballs. More than a pound of meat can overwhelm the sauce, but it will still cook and be yummy. Served with rigatoni in the picture.

#### Ingredients

* olive oil
* 1 lb Italian sausage, meatballs, and/or chicken pieces
* 1/2 c. chopped onion
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 large (2 lb 3 oz) can tomatoes
* 2/3 of a small (6 oz) can of tomato paste
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp oregano or to taste

#### Directions

Brown the meat in the oil (or continue in the pan from my meatball recipe). Remove the meat and brown the onions in the remaining fat. Add the garlic. Return the meat to the pan. Add tomatoes. If you drained whole tomatoes, make up for the liquid with 1/2 c. water. Mix in the tomato paste. Add seasonings. Cook for at least one hour.

### Meatloaf for Passover

#### Ingredients

* 2 lbs. ground beef or ground turkey
* 1 onion
* 1 clove garlic
* 1/2 green bell pepper
* 2 matzot crushed or 1 c. matzah farfel
* 1 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. pepper
* 1 egg, beaten
* 3 T. water

spices to taste: basil, cumin, coriander, mustard, paprika, cayenne pepper

#### Directions

Mix all of the above together. Put into either a Teflon or glass meatloaf pan. Cook for 1 hour in a preheated 350° - 375° oven.

### Beef and Bean Chili

I cut [this recipe](http://www.bhg.com/recipe/beef/beef-and-bean-chili/) roughly in half with my cupboard in mind, so I waffled on the water and ended up leaving it out. I used pinto beans, stewed tomatoes, and a mix of hot peppers I had around the house (2 hot peppers, 2 pepperoncini and one dried chili piquin). I also added a dash of Morrocan spice mix. I tossed in the salt when it was convenient; there's no reason to delay it for canned beans. I made corn bread (this time with all white flour) to replace the corn chips.

#### Ingredients

* 1 lb. lean ground beef
* 1 large onion, chopped (1 c.)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1-2 jalapeño peppers, seeded and finely chopped
* 1 T. chili powder
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* 1 15 ounce can tomato sauce
* 1/4 c. water, optional
* 1 15-16 ounce can kidney beans, rinsed and drained
* 2 T. chopped fresh cilantro
* 1/2 ounce semisweet chocolate, chopped
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 cups corn chips

#### Directions

1. In a Dutch oven brown beef over medium heat; drain off fat. Add onions, garlic, and peppers to pan; cook about 5 minutes or until almost tender. Add the chili powder and cumin; cook for 1 minute, until fragrant. Add tomato sauce and water; bring to boiling. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, covered, for 10 minutes. 
2. Mash one-third of the beans. Stir all beans into chili. Return to simmering; cook about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in the chopped cilantro, chocolate and salt until chocolate is melted. Serve topped with corn chips.


### Beef Curry

The notion of beef curry is just so *wrong* I was reluctant to make this, but I was bored with ground beef so I tried out [Pakistani Kima](http://wholenewmom.com/recipes/ground-hamburger-ground-recipes-recipes-for-indian/) and Peter liked it.  As usual there were alterations--one clove of garlic is never enough!  I made plain rice to go on the side.

#### Ingredients

* 3 T. canola oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 lb. ground beef
* 1 T. muchi curry powder
* 1/2 T. generic curry powder
* 2 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
* 1/8 tsp. black pepper
* 1/8 tsp. cinnamon
* 1/4 tsp. ground ginger
* 1/8 tsp. turmeric
* 1 14 oz. can tomatoes
* 1/3 of a small can of tomato paste
* 4 small fresh tomatoes
* 6 smallish red potatoes, diced
* 2 1/2 c. frozen peas


#### Directions

Cook the potatoes in the can of tomatoes with their juice.  Add water as necessary.

Meanwhile, fry the onion in the oil.  Add garlic.  Add meat and brown.  Add spices.

Add the potato mixture and any remaining ingredients to the meat and onions.  Heat through.
