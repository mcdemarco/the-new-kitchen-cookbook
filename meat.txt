### Fake Bolognese Sauce

I've never been a fan of Bolognese sauce (ground beef belongs in meatballs) but Peter likes it so we threw some together. It turned out to be easy and pretty yummy.

#### Ingredients

* 2 T. olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 3-5 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 lb ground beef
* 2 cubes frozen basil (2 tsp.)
* red pepper flakes to taste
* 1 jar mild commercial sauce (or equivalent amount of canned tomato sauce)

#### Directions

Fry onions in olive oil in a cast iron pan. Add garlic. Add ground beef and brown. Drain off some fat, if you're that sort of person. Add basil and red pepper. Add sauce and heat through. Serve over pasta.

### Meatballs

This was once the family meatball recipe. It may have been through some telephone or dumbing down before it came to me. In addition, I removed some ground pork and Romano cheese, and added onion and an extra egg.

#### Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1/2 cup bread crumbs
* 1/2 cup chopped onion
* 1 clove garlic, minced
* 1 tsp dried parsley
* 2 eggs, beaten
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* olive oil

#### Directions

Brown the onion about 8 minutes in olive oil. Add the garlic for another minute. Remove onion and garlic from oil and put in a bowl with remaining ingredients. (Leave the pan on the heat.) Mix well. Roll into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter. Brown on all sides in pan. Finish cooking meatballs either in oil or in sauce.


### Meat Sauce

This is the sauce that goes with the meatballs. More than a pound of meat can overwhelm the sauce, but it will still cook and be yummy. Served with rigatoni in the picture.

#### Ingredients

* olive oil
* 1 lb Italian sausage, meatballs, and/or chicken pieces
* 1/2 c. chopped onion
* 2 cloves garlic, crushed
* 1 large (2 lb 3 oz) can tomatoes
* 2/3 of a small (6 oz) can of tomato paste
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp oregano or to taste

#### Directions

Brown the meat in the oil (or continue in the pan from my meatball recipe). Remove the meat and brown the onions in the remaining fat. Add the garlic. Return the meat to the pan. Add tomatoes. If you drained whole tomatoes, make up for the liquid with 1/2 c. water. Mix in the tomato paste. Add seasonings. Cook for at least one hour.

### Meatloaf for Passover
