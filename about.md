# About The New Kitchen Cookbook

My recipes were living in SpringPad when I discovered Penflip.  I thought they needed a bit more organization than SpringPad was giving them (and I wanted my recipe descriptions back that SpringPad had dropped for no reason), so I decided to turn them into a real Penflip book.

Penflip was a pretty but buggy front-end to Git and Pandoc whose inconveniences began to outweigh its benefits for me, especially once I integrated the recipes into [my website](http://mcdemarco.net/recipes/).  So I moved the cookbook again, to [GitHub](https://github.com/mcdemarco/the-new-kitchen-cookbook/), where you can see the latest recipes and corrections, if you are technically inclined.
