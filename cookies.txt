# C is for Cookie

It's not really a cookie unless it's made with anise, so let's start there.

## Italian Cookies

### Pizzelles

This is close to the recipe that came with my original iron (which has long since burned out), except for using oil in place of butter. I found the oil version on the Villaware web site back when they made pizzelle irons. My current iron is from Palmer. Virginia Dare makes anise oil. Two teaspoons is a LOT of anise oil. You may want to cut back when serving non-Italians.

#### Ingredients

* 6 eggs
* 1 1/2 c. sugar
* 1 c. pure olive oil
* 2 tsp. anise oil (or 2 T. anise extract)
* 3 1/2 c. flour
* 4 tsp. baking powder

#### Directions

Plug in pizzelle iron. Grease and heat according to manufacturer's instructions.

Beat eggs. Beat in sugar. Add oil and anise. Mix baking powder in with the flour and gradually add it all to the dough. Bake in a pizzelle iron 30 seconds each or until the steam stops.

### Pizzelles by the Egg; Chocolate Pizzelles, Eggnog Pizzelles

![eggnog pizzelle](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/36d02/36d02002b5a1ca9c5731940f75b1424e/43371af3-e39f-4346-b398-d044147112b3.jpg)

I sometimes go up to 8 eggs or experiment with a couple, so I broke down the pizzelle recipe to a single egg.  Peter is responsible for the eggnog variant.

#### Ingredients

* 1 egg
* 1/4 c. sugar
* 1/6 c. pure olive oil (2 T. + 2 tsp)
* 1 tsp. extract (or 1/4 tsp. flavor oil)
* scant 2/3 c. flour
* 2/3 tsp. baking powder

For real pizzelles use anise extract or oil. 

For chocolate pizzelles use vanilla extract and add: 1 T. cocoa 1 T. sugar 

For eggnog pizzelles use half the vanilla extract and add: 1/4 tsp. nutmeg 1/3 tsp. ground clove 

For other flavors use extract or oil.

#### Directions

Plug in pizzelle iron.  Grease and heat according to manufacturer's instructions.

Beat eggs. Beat in sugar. Add oil and anise. Mix baking powder in with the flour and gradually add it all to the dough. Bake in a pizzelle iron 30 seconds each or until the steam stops.

### Pistachio Biscotti

As I mentioned, I burned out my first pizzelle iron.  On the day that it gasped its last gasp, I had already made the cookie dough, so I had to find something else to do with it.  I got out my Italian cookbook and discovered that biscotti had almost the same ingredients, so I adjusted the flour and learned to make biscotti.

![cooling](https://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/080d9/080d94affd82e2bd62cd5e3098119c78/4336a3c6-93d6-4cf4-bb1a-05637f5b5a43.jpg)

This recipe is for non-dairy pistachio biscotti. The yield depends on how you form and cut the logs. I've never gotten as few as the 18 the original recipe alleged. These are my friend Sarah's favorite of my rather small cookie repertoire.  Based on Recipe #44360 on the now-defunct Recipezaar, which included butter, lemon zest, and an almond option. (I use #300513 for almond biscotti.)

#### Ingredients

* 3 c. all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 c. sugar
* 1/2 c. pure olive oil (or vegetable oil, but NOT extra virgin olive oil)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp almont extract
* a few drops lemon extract (optional)
* 1 cup chopped pistachios

#### Directions

Heat oven to 325°. Combine flour and baking powder and set aside. Whisk together eggs, sugar, oil, extracts, and salt in a large bowl. Stir in flour combination. Stir in nuts. 

Form dough into one or two long narrow logs on parchment paper on an insulated cookie sheet. Bake 30 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Cool 15 minutes. 

![cooked log](https://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/57508/57508ee6dc7cb27a2961696fac2733f4/433b2354-06f6-4bcc-bd9e-e3c205cb903e.jpg)

Cut log(s) on an angle into 1/2 inch slices using a very sharp or serrated knife. 

![raw slices](https://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/65f86/65f86869a196666dd933e06f639a82e6/43354ab3-65be-4281-8892-a686dc3f9b7a.jpg)

Lay slices flat on an uninsulated cookie sheet and bake 10-12 minutes or until golden on each side. (The recipe inconveniently makes about 1 1/4 toasting batches.) Cool on wire rack. 

### Anise Cookies

![anise drop cookies](https://springpad.com/proxy/userdata/517b3/517b3ce5d6510e55ba8a64de13a09bc6/433cba47-6a73-46ef-8fb8-dd939ded8151.jpg)

I cut this down from another recipe, [Auntie Mella’s Italian Cookies](http://theapronarchives.com/2012/04/05/auntie-mellas-italian-soft-anise-cookies/), because I only had two eggs. I also made it non-dairy and switched to anise oil.  Note that you can use a cake ball pan for these--the only use I've found yet for my cake-ball pan.

#### Ingredients

Cookies:
* 2 eggs
* 2 2/3 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. anise oil
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 2 2/3 c. flour
* 1/2 c. pure olive oil
* 1/3 c. soy milk 

Icing:
* 1 1/3 c. powdered sugar
* 4 tsp.-2 T. soy milk
* 1/8 tsp. anise oil

#### Directions

Mix eggs, sugar, and anise. Add oil and milk. Add flour and baking powder. Roll out walnut-sized and place on parchment-paper lined cookie sheets (or drop into cake ball pan). Bake 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees. Mix icing. Dip and sprinkle.

## American Cookies

### Chocolate Chip Cookies

I tend to make the Classic Crunchy Chocolate Chip cookies from the King Arthur Cookie book; they also have a [recipe online](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe) which is not either recipe from the book.  I replace the butter with more shortening.  Sometimes I cut down the recipe from the full 4 1/2 dozen to 3 dozen, thus:

#### Ingredients

* 2/3 c. shortening
* 2/3 c. brown sugar
* 1/3 c. white sugar
* 1 1/3 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp. salt
* 2 tsp. cider vinegar
* 2/3 of an egg
* 2/3 tsp. baking soda
* 1 1/3 c. flour
* 2 c. chocolate chips

#### Directions

Cream together all but the last four ingredients.  Add egg. Add baking soda with flour.  Add chocolate chips.

Bake 1 T. per cookie on a greased baking sheet at 350° for 12-14 minutes.  Cool on a rack.

### Almond Butter Cutouts

![cutout suns](https://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/0b681/0b681c818a8e32fea6aef985d226abb1/433e637f-d158-4013-b0c3-36655b3fc978.jpg)

These are non-dairy almond butter cookie-cutter cookies I made for a solstice/Armageddon party. I cut them out with a sun-shaped cookie cutter from Tags. I started with the Peanut Butter Cutouts recipe from The King Arthur Flour Cookie Companion because I meant to make peanut butter cookies, but my jar of peanut butter was crunchy and the almond butter was smooth. I had the non-dairy almond cream hanging around. I tried to make the Vanilla Glaze from the cookie book using almond cream as well, but it came out too runny.

#### Ingredients

* 1/2 c. Crisco (shortening) + 1 T. water
* 1/2 c. smooth almond butter
* 1 c. sugar
* 3/4 tsp. salt
* 1/2 tsp. baking soda
* 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp. almond extract
* 1 egg
* 1/4 cup almond cream
* 3 T. cornstarch
* 3 c. all-purpose flour

#### Directions

Beat together first seven ingredients (up to the egg). Beat in egg. Beat in cornstarch, half the flour, and half the cream. Mix in remaining cream and flour. Divide dough and refrigerate 1 hour. 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Roll dough out between two sheets of parchment paper to 1/4 to 1/8 inches thickness, depending on desired crunchiness. Cut out a dozen cookies and place on parchment paper on a cookie sheet. Bake 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on a rack. Repeat as necessary. Taste for almondy goodness and frost with almond-extract flavored icing if needed.

## Other Cookie Nationalities

### Nan Berenji

![Nan berenji](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/ea032/ea032e57a937ff02c37dea9b107c8f3f/4336eef0-59c0-4efb-a0ed-4328a59ba427.jpg)

This is my classic rice flour cookie recipe that I've been making for years. It's from _Sephardic Cooking_ by Copeland Marks (p. 186).  I also experimented with a Nan Berenji recipe in the _New Food of Life_ cookbook, but that one failed.

#### Ingredients

* 1 stick butter or margarine
* 2/3 c. sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 T. water
* 2 c. rice flour
* 1/4 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. ground cardamom
* 2 tsp. poppy seeds.

#### Directions

Cream butter and sugar. Mix in eggs and water. Add dry ingredients (except poppy seed). Roll 1 heaping tsp. at a time and press down onto greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with poppy seed. Bake 20 minutes at 350°.

### Red Bean Paste Hamantaschen

![hamantaschen](http://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/1ae40/1ae40df861f63887396361fbb149b46d/433ffce2-2f8b-4f4e-b7ad-3426d0e56b78.jpg)

Peter had made red bean paste hamantaschen once before. I'm not a big fan of hamantaschen, but I am of red bean paste, so I tried it out. We also made a couple of refrigerator surprise hamantaschen; those are best left undocumented.

#### Directions

I followed the [chunky recipe](http://www.applepiepatispate.com/japanese/sweet-azuki-red-bean-paste/) (1 c. dried beans and 1 c. white sugar) for red bean paste, but stuck my blender stick in it to smooth it out quite a bit.

![red bean paste](https://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/441cd/441cd214f289ac513b3f02481bfbe76d/433e3d85-93cc-4023-8a65-c0bdbfbd2906.jpg)

I tried to follow the hamantaschen recipe from my King Arthur cookie cookbook, but it came out too dry so I had to gradually add water like for pastry. I'll try a different recipe next year. 

![hexagons](https://springpad-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/1111e/1111e3a10ef09d48b50aef0d6886f8ae/43327558-5947-4ec2-8b27-41242975725a.jpg)

I cut these out with hexagon cookie cutters (about 3 1/4 inch across), folded them up in the middle of 3 sides of the hexagon, and glued them with egg yolk as the recipe recommended. The outcome was more like tiny red bean paste pies than regular hamantaschen, but we liked them that way.
