# Cookie!

It's not really a cookie unless it's made with anise, so let's start there.

## Italian Cookies

### Pizzelles

### Biscotti

### Anise Cookies

I cut this down from another recipe, [Auntie Mella’s Italian Cookies](http://theapronarchives.com/2012/04/05/auntie-mellas-italian-soft-anise-cookies/), because I only had two eggs. I also made it non-dairy and switched to anise oil.

#### Ingredients

Cookies:
* 2 eggs
* 2 2/3 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. anise oil
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 2 2/3 c. flour
* 1/2 c. pure olive oil
* 1/3 c. soy milk 

Icing:
* 1 1/3 c. powdered sugar
* 4 tsp.-2 T. soy milk
* 1/8 tsp. anise oil

#### Directions

Mix eggs, sugar, and anise. Add oil and milk. Add flour and baking powder. Roll out walnut-sized and place on parchment-paper lined cookie sheets (or drop into cake ball pan). Bake 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees. Mix icing. Dip and sprinkle.

### Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Other Cookies

### Nan Berenji

This is my classic rice flour cookie recipe that I've been making for years. It's from Sephardic Cooking by Copeland Marks (p. 186).  I also experimented with a Nan Berenji recipe in the _New Food of Life_ cookbook, but that one failed.

#### Ingredients

* 1 stick butter or margarine
* 2/3 c. sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 T. water
* 2 c. rice flour
* 1/4 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. ground cardamom
* 2 tsp. poppy seeds.

#### Directions

Cream butter and sugar. Mix in eggs and water. Add dry ingredients (except poppy seed). Roll 1 heaping tsp. at a time and press down onto greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with poppy seed. Bake 20 minutes at 350°.

### Red Bean Paste Hamantaschen

Peter had made red bean paste hamantaschen once before. I'm not a big fan of hamantaschen, but I am of red bean paste, so I tried it out. We also made a couple of refrigerator surprise hamantaschen; those are best left undocumented.

#### Directions

I followed the [chunky recipe](http://www.applepiepatispate.com/japanese/sweet-azuki-red-bean-paste/) (1 c. dried beans and 1 c. white sugar) for red bean paste, but stuck my blender stick in it to smooth it out quite a bit. 

I tried to follow the hamantaschen recipe from my King Arthur cookie cookbook, but it came out too dry so I had to gradually add water like for pastry. I'll try a different recipe next year. I cut these out with hexagon cookie cutters (about 3 1/4 inch across), folded them up in the middle of 3 sides of the hexagon, and glued them with egg yolk as the recipe recommended. The outcome was more like tiny red bean paste pies than regular hamantaschen, but we liked them that way.
