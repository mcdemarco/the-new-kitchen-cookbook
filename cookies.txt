# Cookie!

It's not really a cookie unless it's made with anise, so let's start there.

## Italian Cookies

### Pizzelles

### Biscotti

### Anise Cookies

I cut this down from another recipe, [Auntie Mella’s Italian Cookies](http://theapronarchives.com/2012/04/05/auntie-mellas-italian-soft-anise-cookies/), because I only had two eggs. I also made it non-dairy and switched to anise oil.

#### Ingredients

Cookies:
* 2 eggs
* 2 2/3 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. anise oil
* 1/2 c. sugar
* 2 2/3 c. flour
* 1/2 c. pure olive oil
* 1/3 c. soy milk 

Icing:
* 1 1/3 c. powdered sugar
* 4 tsp.-2 T. soy milk
* 1/8 tsp. anise oil

#### Directions

Mix eggs, sugar, and anise. Add oil and milk. Add flour and baking powder. Roll out walnut-sized and place on parchment-paper lined cookie sheets (or drop into cake ball pan). Bake 10-12 minutes at 350 degrees. Mix icing. Dip and sprinkle.

### Chocolate Chip Cookies

## Other Cookies

### Nan Berenji

This is my classic rice flour cookie recipe that I've been making for years. It's from Sephardic Cooking by Copeland Marks (p. 186).  I also experimented with a Nan Berenji recipe in the _New Food of Life_ cookbook, but that one failed.

#### Ingredients

* 1 stick butter or margarine
* 2/3 c. sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 T. water
* 2 c. rice flour
* 1/4 tsp. baking powder
* 1/4 tsp. ground cardamom
* 2 tsp. poppy seeds.

#### Directions

Cream butter and sugar. Mix in eggs and water. Add dry ingredients (except poppy seed). Roll 1 heaping tsp. at a time and press down onto greased cookie sheet. Sprinkle with poppy seed. Bake 20 minutes at 350°.
